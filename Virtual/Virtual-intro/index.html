    <h1 id="virtual-hackweeks">Virtual hackweeks</h1>
<p>The 2020 global coronavirus pandemic has resulted in the cancelation of in-person hackweeks. Many hackweek organizers are wondering whether the core mission of these events can still be achieved in some capacity within a virtual setting. This section describes our ongoing explorations of virtual hackweeks as we experiment with what is possible.</p>
<h2 id="general-logistics">General logistics</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>time zones</strong>: One benefit of virtual meetings is that people from all around the world can attend. It is important to be mindful of scheduling to ensure people in as many time zones as possible can attend any live virtual offerings. For hackweeks with a wide distribution of participants it may be important to offer recordings of live content so that everyone has access to material.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>virtual platform</strong>: There are many video conferencing technologies. In our experience, <a href="http://zoom.us">Zoom</a> is the most stable and offers an excellent range of tools to enable interactivity in an online setting. Many universities use Zoom but not all organizations have access to this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>accessibility</strong>: Once a virtual platform has been chosen, be sure to poll participants to ensure they are able to use that system. Some organizations, for example federal agencies operating under enhanced security restrictions, do not allow their employees to join certain virtual technology platforms unless it is provisioned by that agency. Additionally, it is important not to assume that everyone has the computer hardware, or the necessary at-home internet bandwidth, that enables them to take advantage of all aspects of virtual technologies. For example, some participants may have an old computer that has no built-in video. Or in some cases, video and audio settings may be restricted for people using hardware provided by their agency or company. Finally, some peole may not have access to a laptop or tablet, and need to connect via their smartphone, which will offer a more limited range of funcationality.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, be sure to clearly articulate what tools and technologies are required, and be ready to work with individuals in advance of the hackweek who might need assistance. It helps to provide links in advance to the audio/video testing sites that most virtual platforms offer.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>take breaks</strong>: Virtual meetings can be draining in ways that are different from in-person meetings. Include a sufficient number of breaks in your schedule to give people ample opportunity to move around. During the break, share a slide that states the break duration and the time for reconvening. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="virtual-etiquette">Virtual etiquette</h2>
<p>Establishing protocols and habbits around virtual etiquette is important early in the hackweek. Whenever a group is meeting for the first time it is helpful to provide reminders on the following points (these could be posted on a slide that is shared on everyone's screen):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>keeping video turned on</strong>: invite everyone to stay visually connected with their video enabled. You may wish to establish a shared understanding that if someone's vido is off, it means they are taking a break. This protocol can be flexible considering some people may not have a functioning video connection. </li>
<li><strong>mute when not speaking</strong>: this is especially relevant with many households having multiple adults working from home, and children being home from school. Remind participants to unmute when it is time for them to speak.</li>
<li><strong>name and location label</strong>: most virtual platforms allow you to show your name somewhere next to your video window. If not already done, teach participants how to update their full name, together with their geographic location if relevant.</li>
<li><strong>stating name before speaking</strong>: in the event that people are attending without video, advise participants to speak their name first, as is common in an audio-only conference.</li>
<li><strong>chat function</strong>: explain how to access the chat window, and remind people about the differences between chats with individuals versus the full group. You may wish to establish norms around the use of chat. In some cases, you might want to discourage it since it can be distracting.</li>
<li><strong>gallery and speaker views</strong>: many platforms offer different ways to view the group of people who are online. For example, Zoom has a speaker and a gallery view. For large groups, gallery may be recommended. Note that the maximum size of the gallery view can be modified in Zoom.</li>
<li><strong>security considerations</strong>: The rapid uptick in Zoom usage has led to some unfortunate events, so-called "Zoom bombs" where unauthorized attendees distrupt an existing meeting. The University of Washington has posted some useful <a href="https://itconnect.uw.edu/connect/phones/conferencing/zoom-video-conferencing/security-settings/">guidelines for protecting Zoom meetings</a>. </li>
</ul>
