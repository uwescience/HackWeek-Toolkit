    <h1 id="how-to-set-up-hacks-and-projects">How to Set Up Hacks and Projects</h1>
<p>One of the key components for a successful hack week is to guide participants through the 
process of setting up and working on hacks. The different hack weeks have different approaches 
to this: for example, Astro Hack Week tends to provide less structure that allows for more free-form 
work, while Geo Hack Week offers a more structured approach, where project teams stay together the 
entire week and projects have designated Project Leads and Data Science Leads.</p>
<h2 id="a-note-on-the-terminology-of-hacking">A Note on the terminology of "hacking"</h2>
<p>In recent years, hackathons have become popular in the tech industry and beyond. They often span anywhere 
between 24 to 48 hours, where participants are expected to work continuously with little to no sleep on 
solutions to a specific problem. They often involve a competition for prize money (or equivalent) for the 
best solution, and companies are known to use them as recruiting events.</p>
<p>While popular among groups, many people have rightfully criticized that model on the grounds of promoting 
an unhealthy and exclusionary culture, where coding is prioritized over physical health and there is tacit 
acceptance that only those can participate who can devote a full 24 or 48 hours to the hackathon (i.e. have 
for example no childcare responsibilities, or no medical reasons that prevent them from sitting in front of a 
computer for long periods of time). In addition, women, non-binary people and members of other underrepresented 
groups in science and the technology sector have traditionally been underrepresented at hackathons, and many 
have made an explicit choice not to attend any following negative experiences, some of which are summarized 
<a href="https://www.pilanites.com/no-more-hackathons/">in this blog post</a>.</p>
<p>As organizers of events called "hack weeks", we are generally concerned that the name of the event might prevent 
some researchers to not apply in the first place, and that this might be especially true for researchers from 
demographics that have traditionally been excluded (explicitly or implicitly) from hackathons. At Astro Hack Week, 
the organizing committee has a discussion every year whether to rename the event. For now, our decision has 
been to try and reclaim the term "hacking" and put it into a more positive context: one where we aim to make 
the event inclusive and welcoming, and actively counteract some of the negative dynamics often present in 
the traditional hackathon model. Key differences between our hack weeks and the traditional hackathon model 
are that we strive to organize them during regular business hours to accommodate participants with care 
responsibilities, offer care grants, emphasize the problem-solving and community-centric (rather than competitive)
nature of our events. However, we continue to have this discussion, and may come to a different 
conclusion in the future.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that hackathon organizers are increasingly aware of the problems with the hackathon 
model, and are working to counter-act them by designing events that focus on <a href="https://makethebreastpumpnotsuck.com">communities of colour</a>, emphasize <a href="https://hackbrightacademy.com/blog/awesomely-inclusive-radically-transparent-hackathon/">empathy and an experience-centric design</a>, and provide e.g. <a href="https://handbook.floeproject.org/InclusiveMakingAndHacking.html">inclusive design guides</a>. </p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-hack">What is a Hack</h2>
<p>The terms "hack" and "hacking" can lead to some confusion, especially among people outside the data
science, tech and open source communities, where "hacking" is usually synonymous with illegally gaining
entry to a computer system.</p>
<p>This is <em>not</em> what we mean by "hack". In our definition, a hack is a small project with a clear goal,
which should be completed by the time initially allocated to it. Because the problems that researchers
think about tend to be complex, defining such a project often requires significant <em>simplification</em>, or
taking a quick approach to solving that problem. The idea of a hackathon, in our definition, is to foster
the idea of hacking as a fun, interactive and welcoming environment to explore and experiment with new
ideas, concepts and methods.</p>
<p>Because hacks are time-bounded, they should be <em>results-driven</em>, which means it is important for those
proposing a hack to plan a little in advance. At the same time, <em>results-driven</em> does not necessarily mean
<em>successful</em>: in our hack weeks we always aim to foster an environment where a negative result is celebrated
equally as a result that helps the community learn about how <em>not</em> to approach a problem.</p>
<p>In our hack weeks, we aim to foster a sense of joy and learning through experimentation, and hacks are often 
prototypes or initial explorations that may lead to larger and longer-term projects, rather than one-off 
solutions to a particular challenge.</p>
<p>Different hack weeks have a somewhat different outlook on what kinds of projects specifically are "hacks": for 
example, Geo Hack Week explicitly focuses on outcomes that involve computer code, while Astro Hack Week 
considers a wider range of projects as hacks: these can be policy documents and white papers, a new logo for 
a group or software project, or even sowing projects, to name but a few examples. In addition, Astro Hack Week 
runs a <em>community hack day</em> as part of Astro Hack Week every year: this day is set aside explicitly for 
participants of Astro Hack Week to work on projects that benefit the astronomy community as a whole.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-projects">Setting Up Projects</h2>
<p>Many participants may have an idea for a hack, but may not have participated in a hack week before, and thus 
will appreciate guidance on how to set up a functional project, how to define time-bounded outcomes and 
milestones. At Astro Hack Week, we use a <a href="">Hack Template</a> to guide participants through the process of 
defining hacks. GeoHackWeek asks the teams to designate a team lead and data science lead, and start a 
GitHub repository with important project information in its README. While at Astro Hack Week researchers 
ideally come with a project they have thought of in terms of the provided template, Geo Hack Week allows 
teams to form and then guides the teams through a structure to clarify the key problem as well as the most 
promising approaches to solving that problem.
In both cases, guidance to participants includes defining the key problem in terms of why it is important to 
solve that particular problem, and to write down the specific questions that are to be asked. In addition, 
we ask participants to identify the proposed methods and tools used to solve it, as well as what skills and 
knowledge from the participants might be helpful to achieve the goal.
Organizers should encourage participants proposing projects to think carefully about how early-stage learners 
can meaningfully contribute to their projects. Our hack weeks often include learners with little to no technical 
knowledge, which puts them at risk of exclusion in an environment dominated by researchers experienced in writing 
code and developing new and advanced methods. 
In this context, it can also be helpful to encourage projects that don't directly require advanced technical 
skills, especially if they are proposed by those participants themselves. For example, Astro Hack Week has 
seen projects e.g. where a group of learners taught themselves a particular technical skill through generally 
available tutorials, then wrote an astronomy-themed tutorial on that skill as part of their hack. Similarly, 
early-career participants at Astro Hack Week have hacked for example on knowledge resources for graduate school 
applications and creative projects like designing the logo for a software package.</p>
<h2 id="checking-in-with-the-team">Checking in with the Team</h2>
<p>For organizers, it is important to periodically check in with the teams. This can happen in a structured way 
(e.g. Geo Hack Week has a formal check-in with guided activities on Day 3), or informally (Astro Hack Week 
has one or more facilitators move through the room, observe the team work process and step in with advice or 
requests as needed). It is especially important to look out for participants who are very junior, whose 
potential to meaningfully contribute might get lost as more experienced team members rapidly prototype 
complex solutions.
Including early-stage learners and ensuring that they can meaningfully
contribute to the projects (for example by trying out a new method and finding bugs, writing a tutorial for other 
early-stage learners, etc.) and that their contributions are valued fully and equally by the team is an important 
facilitation task during project work.</p>
