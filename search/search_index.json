This includes direct costs such as rooms and catering, as well as indirect costs including the salaries of the organizing committee. Below, we have an abbreviated list of costs that commonly occur during a hack week. In this folder, you can also find detailed budgets from individual hack weeks, which might give you a closer guidance on how to budget your own event. Common Budget Items Here are some items that we often encounter in organizing a hack week: room/venue bookings catering for coffee, biscuits and lunches housing costs if housing is provided to participants conference dinner and receptions fractional salary of some or all of the organizers and administrative staff travel funding for some or all participants travel funding for tutorial leads + organizing committee local travel arrangements (e.g. bus between hotel + venue, to conference dinner, etc) incidentals (printing badges, lanyards, gifts for tutorial speakers etc) Not all hack weeks incur all of these costs, and some of these costs might be directly covered by the venue (for example, some venues automatically provide administrative support) and never appear on your budget. In addition, many of the hack week organizers are on the committee as volunteers who do not draw monetary compensation. However, while some of these costs may be hidden, it is worthwhile keeping them in mind, for example when applying for specific grants to support the hack week. Fundraising for a Hack Week Here are some of the sources of funding we have relied on in past events: early hack weeks at the University of Washington were supported by the [Moore-Sloan Data Science Envrionments] (http://msdse.org/) various department across university systems (e.g. Applied Mathematics, Information Technology, Computer Science) federal research grants from the National Institutes of Health, the National Sceience Foundation, NASA and other agencies. industry sponsorship from a wide range of companies such as commercial cloud and commercial satellite providers participant fees Charging Participant Fees Organizers should first determine whether charging a fee is allowed under the rules of any federal awards that might be supporting the event. If fees are allowed, then organizers may wish to charge a small participant fee for hack weeks helps ensure that people who sign up commit to attending. In the past we have charged betwee $75 - $100 which we feel is low enough not to deter people without sufficient funds from even applying. If budgets allow we often waive participant fees for people expressing financial need.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Budgets/Budgets-Intro/#budgeting-and-funding-a-hack-week","text":"Like any other workshop, hack weeks cost money.

What does successful even mean, and how do we define metrics for that success? Hack weeks take a great deal of work to organize, and as organizers we often want to know whether the time and effort spent on the organization was valuable. Did the workshop serve the needs we hoped it would serve? Did it fulfil the goals and objectives we settled on during the organization? Did participants enjoy the experience, did they feel comfortable and welcome? Here is where evaluation of the hack week, of its elements, organizational structure and design decisions is important. Without evaluation, there is no learning about the event as a whole, and no potential for improvement. We therefore recommend that organizing committees incorporate evaluation and feedback mechanisms into the design and implementation of their participant-driven events. Running Experiments We try to follow established best practices as much as possible at our hack weeks. For many design decisions that need to be made during implementation, there is a huge amount of research and knowledge available that we can draw from (e.g. best practices for teaching computational methods), some of which we aim to share on the resources page. However, as organizers we also acknowledge that we do not necessarily have the deep knowledge on the current state of research in all topics that are relevant to hack week organization, and that we are learners, too. And for some things, like how to facilitate the creation of hacks and the formation of project teams, there is no established best-practices wisdom to our knowledge. While learning and improving our knowledge of research areas that directly touch the hack week model where we can, we often implement new ideas as experiments where that knowledge isn't available. We have an idea that might improve the workshop, for example in facilitation of the project work, or perhaps we are in a new location with rooms that have particular features. Often we don't know whether this new idea will improve the workshop overall (or what \"improve\" even means in that context!), but we would like to know. Implementing these changes as experiments has a number of advantages: * Implementing experiments (as opposed to a structure that is just assumed to work) allows for innovation, because it allows for constructively questioning and critiquing organizational structures, which may be in place for no other reason than \"this person five years ago thought it was a good idea\". * Experiments allow for constructive failure. Any experiment might run the risk that they might not work . Nobody wants a terrible workshop, but there is a wide space between perfection and \"this particular thing didn't work out so well\" where experiments can help inform future decisions, and allows us to improve on designs that may be adequate, but not actually good . * Experiments allow for iterative improvement, and therefore can help remove some of the pressure on the organizing committee of having to get all decisions perfectly right all the time. Organizing participant-driven events can be a daunting task, especially for new organizing committees. Experiments remove some of the pressure (imagined or not) of having to design a perfect workshop in a space where there may not exist knowledge about how to do that for their particular community. Experiments can be a hugely useful tool, but in order for them to work, they require innovation. As in our scientific work, where we form a hypothesis, collect data and subsequently analyse that data to confirm or reject our hypothesis, hack week experiments should be set up with a clear hypothesis, a way to collect relevant data, and a pathway for evaluation at the end. As organizers come up with new ideas they want to try out, they should simultaneously consider how they will figure out whether this idea was worthwhile, and how to measure success. Different forms of Evaluation Evaluation can take a number of different forms, both formal and informal. At the basic level, organizers might want to get together at the end of or after the workshop, and discuss their experiences, observations and conclusions. At Astro Hack Week, for example, we often either have dinner as an organizing committee on the last night, to discuss any experiences and issues while they are fresh in people's minds, or a follow-up online call shortly after the end of the hack week. These observations are often helpful as an overall, birds-eye view of the hack week from the perspective of the organizers: how did the group respond to a certain tutorial? Did the room facilitate the hacking, or were there many issues due to the lack of power outlets? Were most people embedded in project teams, or were there many working on their own? Observations from the organizers can only give a very incomplete view of the workshop, however. Organizers have thought about the hack week for months, and often know the precise motivation for certain design decisions. They are likely to be blind to a number of issues, especially those that might affect first-time attendees or people from backgrounds not shared by anyone on the organizing committee. Participant feedback is therefore a crucial tool for evaluating specific experiments as well as the experience attendees had as a whole. It is useful to have a feedback mechanism available during the hack week itself, so that organizers can respond promptly to any issues being flagged: for example, the group of organizers (or a subset) may be designated as contact persons for feedback, and can make themselves available for participants to raise issues. However, there may be sensitive issues that participants do not want to raise in person. For these situations, having an anonymous feedback mechanism is useful to gather information. For example, participants could be encouraged to write sticky notes and paste them to a wall as they leave the room. If this is too public, there could be a box with paper and pens, for example in the coffee area, where feedback can be shared anonymously, to be read by the organizers e.g. during a lunch break or after the end of the day, who can then make timely decisions on whether they need to take action. While an anonymous feedback box is valuable for feedback that requires immediate action, it is also valuable to gather information from participants near the end of or after the hack week, which may then drive design decisions for the next workshop or hack week. Because our hack weeks came out of the Moore-Sloan Data Science Environment , we have always been interested in hack weeks in the context of career trajectories of the attending researchers, models for learning computational skills, how physical space affects learning and collaboration, the uptake of (open-source) software tools and Open Science and reproducibility frameworks. With these in mind, we have designed a shared end-of-survey workshop that we use across hack weeks, which is available in PDF and Qualtrics format in the HackWeek Toolkit repository on GitHub . Beyond the questions, which we desiged with the help of affiliated social science researchers, we also ask specific questions about the participants' experiences that we are interested in as feedback for the workshop in general or particular elements. For example, we ask whether participants felt they learned useful skills from each of the tutorials, whether the space they were in was conducive to project work, and whether they would prefer more tutorial content or open project time in future iterations of the workshop. These questions are usually designed to elicit specific information we are interested in, but we also share a number of open-ended questions aimed at eliciting both positive and negative feedback, identifying issues that participants didn't feel comfortable raising during the workshop, but also helping us identify activities or design choices that participants liked particularly well. It is important that these surveys do not get too long. While there are many things we as organizers want to know about, there is a level of fatigue associated with long surveys, and participants are less likely to fill them out, and be as detailed as we hope them to be, if the survey is very long. In general, we aim to set aside a block of time (around 20 minutes) on the last day, for example after lunch, where we invite participants to fill out the survey, and specifically explain why this is important to us, and what we will do with the information they share. Response rates drop sharply after the end of the event, and running the feedback survey exclusively after the end of the event has never generated response rates higher than 50%. Ethnographic Field Work The hack weeks have generated some interest from social science researchers who work on topics related to research and open-source communities. Over the course of the past few years, we have had several researchers visit the hack weeks and conduct field work while there. These have been very fruitful collaborations, and some researchers have shared their work with us in various ways, which has provided an important outside view on the community, generating insights that are not easily available to those of us who are embedded in the community and take many of its norms and traditions for granted. One example of a summary of field notes shared with us were provided in the form of a blog post by Brittany Fiore-Gartland . Our work around addressing and mitigating the prevalence of impostor phenomenon has been a direct consequence of the insights she shared with us at the end of the week.","title":"Evaluation"},{"location":"Evaluation/Evaluation-Intro/#evaluation","text":"How do we know whether the hack week was successful?

With these in mind, we have designed a shared end-of-survey workshop that we use across hack weeks, which is available in PDF and Qualtrics format in the HackWeek Toolkit repository on GitHub . Beyond the questions, which we desiged with the help of affiliated social science researchers, we also ask specific questions about the participants' experiences that we are interested in as feedback for the workshop in general or particular elements. For example, we ask whether participants felt they learned useful skills from each of the tutorials, whether the space they were in was conducive to project work, and whether they would prefer more tutorial content or open project time in future iterations of the workshop. These questions are usually designed to elicit specific information we are interested in, but we also share a number of open-ended questions aimed at eliciting both positive and negative feedback, identifying issues that participants didn't feel comfortable raising during the workshop, but also helping us identify activities or design choices that participants liked particularly well. It is important that these surveys do not get too long. While there are many things we as organizers want to know about, there is a level of fatigue associated with long surveys, and participants are less likely to fill them out, and be as detailed as we hope them to be, if the survey is very long. In general, we aim to set aside a block of time (around 20 minutes) on the last day, for example after lunch, where we invite participants to fill out the survey, and specifically explain why this is important to us, and what we will do with the information they share. Response rates drop sharply after the end of the event, and running the feedback survey exclusively after the end of the event has never generated response rates higher than 50%.","title":"Different forms of Evaluation"},{"location":"Evaluation/Evaluation-Intro/#ethnographic-field-work","text":"The hack weeks have generated some interest from social science researchers who work on topics related to research and open-source communities.

For example, we have both early undergraduate students all the way to faculty members and senior industry experts, and the differential in computational and data analysis skills can be quite wide (though they don't have to be: Astro Hack Week has seen undergraduates teach senior faculty about things like databases!). In this context, Astro Hack Week operates on the principle that every participant has valuable skills to contribute, and that their unique life experience make them a valued member of our community. It's also worth nothing that participants come to Astro Hack Week with very different goals: some come primarily to learn, some come to make progress on a specific (PhD) research project, some come to collaborate with specific people, and others want to learn more about how to run a hackathon. The breadth of indv Perhaps the key challenge for us as organizers and facilitators is helping each participant find and contribute to a project that they are both interested in and that matches up with their goals for learning and participation. In addition, not all participants feel equally comfortable participating, and impostor phenomenon is a common occurrence at Astro Hack Week. The goal of facilitation at Astro Hack Week is to provide an environment where all participants feel welcome, accepted and their contributions are valued. With this in mind, each year there is at least one person whose primary task is facilitation. This includes setting the tone of the meeting and framing the community building in the larger context of the goals of the workshop, leading the group through activities such as ice breakers and hack pitches, and going around the room during project time to make sure the teams are functioning well and all participants are able to participate to the level that they wish to. Usually, the person facilitating does not work on a hack themselves (though in 2019, the facilitation was shared between three organizers to allow hack time for each person). The first day is particularly important in the context of facilitating the event. It sets the tone for the rest of the week, and many participants will meet each other for the first time ever. This can be particularly intimidating to junior participants, and so making sure that everyone has the chance to meet others is a core goal. In addition, the design and pitching of projects, as well as the team formation happens on the first afternoon. This, too, requires careful facilitation to ensure the teams are off to a welcoming, healthy and productive start. As organizers, it is very difficult to know what's in the participants' minds, and the participants' lived experience might lead them to react to certain activities very differently than we as organizers expect. We have a number of feedback mechanisms that we have implemented to receive feedback both during the week (which may allow us to make changes immediately) and at the end of the workshop (for implementation during a future event). In addition, it is worth noting that all group activities are framed as invitations : we do not insist that participants take part in events that require social interaction, which would be actively hostile to our participants and also counter-productive. We rather invite participants to take part based on how well they feel able to do so. One notable exception to the rule is the Code of Conduct: we do require all participants to adhere to the Astro Hack Week Code of Conduct, and ask participants to confirm their willingness to do so upon applying to the workshop. With the above considerations in mind, we have implemented some activities to guide participants through Astro Hack Week. These are all based on the following ground rules that we as organizers and facilitators strive to follow and implement during the week: The code of conduct sets the ground rules and minimum standard for all interactions Remind participants repeatedly to think about their interactions, the dynamics within their interactions and groups the space they occupy (relative to others) the distribution of talking time/space to participate Also remind participants to pay particular attention to known dynamics (e.g. with respect to academic seniority, gender, race, \u2026) Do not interrupt speakers (unless they won\u2019t shut up) Encourage questions and give others the benefit of the doubt (don\u2019t tell people \u201cI can\u2019t believe you don\u2019t know this!\u201d or something of the sort) Encourage participants to engage critically with and think about how they interact with others Story Board Add story board here! Detailed Descriptions of Activities Community Building: Impromptu Networking Description : Impromptu Networking When : Very early on, before the first coffee break (as needed potentially every morning) Duration : ~15-20 minutes Why : Provide a non-threatening environment for first interactions between participants, reduce barriers to interactions, gives them a chance to introduce themselves to others and get to know them in a short while. The short amount of time for each interaction reduces the chance for participants to \u201cpanic\u201d about making a good first impression. Also aims to set the tone for the week and get participants to think about their own goals and obstacles for the week. The responses have to be fast, so they\u2019re designed to be stream-of-consciousness and somewhat unpolished. What : Invite everyone to stand up and spread through the room. Ask them to find someone they haven\u2019t met before. They have 120 seconds to introduce themselves to each other and complete the sentence displayed on the slide (see below for examples). After 120 seconds, ring bell and get participants to switch to a new partner, with a new sentence. Repeat ~7-8 times. Remind participants that 120 seconds is short, and that they\u2019re responsible for giving the other person enough time for their answer. Materials : Bell, slides with sentences to be completed. Sample Statements : What first inspired me in this work is \u2026 One thing I\u2019d like to learn this week is \u2026 A challenge I hope we make progress on is \u2026 I belong at Astro Hack Week because \u2026 Something I am proud of is \u2026 Something I plan to give to this community is ... My hope is that people will experience me as \u2026 Astro Hack Week will be a success for me if \u2026 For fun, I \u2026 In my free time, I like to ... When it\u2019s all said and done, all I want is \u2026 Additional statements, if the exercise is repeated in the mornings throughout the week: Yesterday, I learned that \u2026 In my interactions with others, I particularly enjoyed ... Today, I\u2019d like to try to ... Observations and Feedback : Participants took part in this at Astro Hack Week fairly enthusiastically. Not all used the prompts, some just introduced themselves and chatted about what they planned to do this week, and that's perfectly fine, too. There were two important observations and feedback that are relevant for future uses of this activity: Some of the statements might be triggering for participants with social anxiety and mental health issues (e.g. in the first version of this activity one of the prompts read \"A voice I need to stop listening to is ...\"). We've since tried to eliminate those statements, and remain attentive to feedback regarding prompts that might make our participants uncomfortable. One issue with this activity is that 50 people all talking to one another at the same time can get very loud! Ideally, do this activity outside if weather permits, or in a space that allows participants to spread out and that doesn't echo too much. Something that we haven't solved very well so far is how this exercise might work for participants with mobility issues. Because it requires standing and moving about, this might unintentionally exclude some participants. There could be a variant where this exercise involves paired chairs, and only some participants move about. The invitation would be for roughly half of the participants to stand up and find a partner, while the remainder stays seated. In either case, however, it's useful to get participants to move away from the tables they might normally be sitting at and away from their computers, if possible. Introducing and Framing Astro Hack Week When : At the beginning of the week, right after the Impromptu Networking Duration : About 30 minutes Why : Many participants come in with just a vague idea of what Astro Hack Week is and what its goals are. This introduction aims to give participants an overview of the workshop, the practical logistics (schedule, bathrooms, lunches, social events etc.), and especially the rules and expectations for working together and for building an inclusive learning environment. What : About a half-hour presentation by the organizers, covering the elements and structure of the workshop, logistics, the code of conduct and other aspects of working together for the week. At Astro Hack Week, it has been important to us not only to reinforce that the code of conduct is to be followed at all times (both during the workshop itself and social times outside of it), but actively goes into detail how we want participants to behave and interact with one another. This includes welcoming questions and providing useful answers, experimenting with Astro Hack Week itself, trying out something new, listening to each other, respecting each other's pronouns, being kind to one another, and being open to learn about one another, both in terms of technical knowledge as well as from other people's lived experiences. This discussion also includes a note on impostor phenomenon, which we've found to be prevalent at Astro Hack Week. Material : Slides (an example of our slides from Astro Hack Week 2018 is available here ) Building Positive Learning Environments Through a Data Visualization Tutorial During Astro Hack Week 2018 and 2019, the first tutorial of the week was a data visualization tutorial. Because data visualization is one of the less technically complicated topics, and because it allows for many opportunities to practice group interactions, we chose it as a vehicle to also model and practice inclusive group work with our participants. We guided our participants through a series of group activities that allowed them to self-discover important data visualization principles and put them into practice, while also providing them with structures to help them with the project work later. Community Building: 1-2-4 All for Data Visualization Description : 1-2-4-all When : at the start of the data visualization tutorial Duration : 20 minutes (silent reflection: 2 minutes, pairs: 4 minutes, groups of 4: 6 minutes, whole group: 8 minutes; see also feedback + observations below ) Why : Best practices and rules are most easily accepted when they are grounded in the students\u2019 own experiences. Especially with data visualization, more than other fields, there is likely a lot of expertise scattered through the room already, and most participants, even students, are likely to have an intuitive sense of whether a particular visualization is effective at communicating information. This exercise is aimed at co-creating best practices for effective data visualization. The secondary goal is to give participants a structure and a framework for group interactions and working in teams, which they may adopt for the free-form hacking later during the day/week, and reinforce good practices for communicating and cooperating. What : Invite participants to sit down next to someone they don\u2019t know. Each participant gets one data visualization to look at: some sample visualizations are fairly competent at communicating information, some are not. Each participant is then asked to answer three questions (see below) in silent reflection (2 minutes). In the next step, participants are grouped in pairs, and discuss their answers, co-creating a common set of best practices (4 minutes). In the third step, groups of four discuss the common set of best practices and (6 minutes) rank them by importance. In groups of four, a pen or crayon will serve as a talking object. Only the person with the object speaks, and each person mentions one rule, then passes on the object. One person has to be a note-taker (for the shared online document). Participants should invite the most junior person to speak first, but they\u2019re free to say \u201cpass\u201d and let someone else begin. Finally, each team shares a practice with the entire group, which a note-taker records in the shared online document. Once each team has had a chance to speak, if there are further best practices, we go through the groups again and allow each group to mention another best practice. Material : pens/crayons, print-outs of data visualizations, set-up of a shared online document Questions : What information does this data visualization convey What does this data visualization do well in communicating information? Can you think of ways in which you would improve this data visualization? What general rules can you derive for communicating information visually? Observations and Feedback : 20 minutes is way too short for this exercise, partly because participants require more time to take in the visualization and answer the questions, but also because they are excited to share their conclusions both in pairs and groups of four. For the second iteration of this exercise, we restricted ourselves to just two data visualizations, and gave roughly half the participants each. I think 45 minutes is a better time estimate for this exercise in total (5 minutes silent contemplation, 10 minutes in pairs, 15 minutes in groups of four, 15 minute for summary with the group). One suggestion has been to give this exercise more practical structure by providing participants a page with 4 quadrants, each signifying one of the questions. The participants are then asked to note down their observations in each quadrant, and circle one observation in each quadrant that stood out to them. Community Building: Improve a Data Visualization When : In general, the 1-2-4-all exercise above is followed by a bit of a lecture-style introduction into some concepts that give the participants a bit of practical background on some of the visualization principles they co-created (e.g. pre-attentive processing, Gestalt psychology). Following this, the participants get the opportunity to take an existing data visualization and improve upon it. Duration : 60 minutes Why : Learning new principles and ideas functions best through practice and trying it out. In this activity, participants will work in teams of 3-4 to take an existing data visualization and improve upon it visually. Again, this structure aims to give participants a framework for how to interact in teams and learn some of these principles of constructive interaction in a non-threatening setting. What : Participants will be asked to team up in groups of 3-4 and pick a data visualization. It can be a plot they have made (voluntary!), or they can pick one of the ones that the instructors bring along. During the first ten minutes, participants identify improvements to be made in the existing visualization, using the same rules as during the group-phase of the 1-2-4-all: each person gets to say one thing, then passes the talking pen off to the next person. A person who would not like to add anything can say \u201cpass\u201d and pass on the pen. Participants should invite the most junior person to speak first, but they\u2019re free to say \u201cpass\u201d and let someone else begin. One person takes notes. Once all the possible improvements have been put onto paper, participants vote on their top 5 improvements (each gets 3 votes), and start collecting ideas for how to improve in a similar manner as before. They take a piece of paper and pin it to the wall, then use the crayons to draw out a sketch of the new visualization. If there is time, they can attempt to create it on a computer, but emphasis here is on creating a prototype together on paper. During the last 15 minutes, a member of each team will share the results with the rest of the groups. Notes : Some of the design elements of this exercise were chosen particularly to enable positive group collaboration and facilitate the best learning outcome. Do not pick figures from your own field as bad examples for visualizations, unless you can be absolutely sure that the author is not in the room (for example, by choosing your own). Having a figure you might have spent weeks on publicly dissected without being warned that this might be happening is absolutely terrifying and has a chilling effect. You do not want this to happen. Thankfully, the internet is full of terrible, professionally produced visualizations for you to pick from. The exercise explicitly uses crayons on paper, because with computer-based exercises, the group can be too easily side-tracked into specific questions of how to plot one particular thing with that specific plotting library. In addition, team members might have different skill levels in computer-based visualization, which may lead to some participants programming, while others sit at the sidelines being excluded from participating. Secondly, we chose to pin paper to the wall specifically because it means that participants are all facing the same way, toward a common goal. This is markedly different from paper that's spread on a table, with people standing around. In the latter case, participants disagreeing with someone else's suggestion do so while facing them, which can feel more confrontative than while everyone is facing the same way towards the paper on the wall. Material : pens/crayons, print-outs of data visualizations, large sheets of paper, tape, empty walls Observations and Feedback : Expect ~10 minutes to pick a figure, ~30 minutes to prototype a figure, and another ~15 minutes to collect the results (depending on group size, of course; this was for ~50 participants). Participants really enjoyed both the figures and the crayons. It made this much more playful and much less intimidating than it would otherwise have been (and some participants noted that specifically in the feedback). One out of ten groups chose to use their own figure instead of one of those I provided. Putting the (empty) posters on the wall was really helpful, I think, because people started talking about the poster, rather than toward each other (which suggested might be less confrontational). We also observed that many participants who didn\u2019t want to share their group\u2019s conclusions during the first exercise participated enthusiastically in the drawing, so it seemed to have succeeded in getting people to interact. Facilitating the Hacking The project work component of Astro Hack Week requires careful facilitation in particular, because it is otherwise very free-form and can be very intimidating to new participants and those who are introverted and/or shy. In particular pitching potential projects to the entire group requires a lot of self-confidence in one's ideas and ability to convey them in less than a minute. We start this part of the workshop with a short introduction into what a hack is, and the characteristics of a good hack (see also intro slides linked above). We alert participants before the workshop as well, and encourage them to start submitting hack ideas to a shared document (though not many do). I think in the future, it would be worthwhile to have a hack development workshop before actually going into the activities described below, but we haven't tried that out yet. The goal here would be to get those with hack ideas to fill out a hack template that asks relevant questions about the project, to be answered before the project can commence. Hack Pitch Preparation: Impromptu Networking When : Directly after the intro about hacking or a hack development workshop Duration : 6 minutes Why : Standing up in front of the entire group and sharing an idea is a daunting task. Some participants might not be sure whether their idea is something they really want to work on, or whether it\u2019s good enough to share. The round of impromptu networking is an opportunity for participants to test out their idea on a small number of individuals first, refine how they present the core objective of their idea, and decide whether they would like to share it with the group. What : Impromptu networking in this iteration only involves only a single question: \u201cWhat is it you\u2019d like to pursue this week?\u201d Each participant is invited to find another person, ideally one they haven\u2019t interacted with yet. Within two minutes, they answer this question to each other, either in the form of a hack idea, or something else they\u2019d like to achieve. This is more free-form in the sense that the other person can ask questions and it can be more of a conversation. We need to remind participants to be mindful of their time and share it with their partner. After two minutes, participants find a new partner and do the same thing again, 3 times in total. Material : Slides Hack Pitches Duration : as needed, about 15-20 minutes Why : At some point, the group needs to know about the different project ideas, so they can pick which they'd like to work on. We haven't found a good way other than asks people to present their ideas to the group, ideally within about 45 seconds each. What : Each participant gets the opportunity to stand up in front and share their hack idea with the group. Ideally, one would start with 3-4 experienced participants to model how this is best done, then asks some of the newer participants to share their ideas, then go back to some experienced participants. During the hack development phase, participants could also write down short descriptions on a set of slides, or fill out paper versions of the hack template. Those that don't want to stand up in front of the group could ask the organizers to pitch either from the slides or from the shared notes. Material : Potentially slides with hack pitches, a microphone Observations and Feedback : Pitching hacks is scary for some participants, and we haven't yet found a way to lower the barrier for those that are uncertain about stepping in front of the group to pitch their idea. This is definitely an area of future development. Hack Sorting Duration : about 30 minutes Why : Once all hacks are pitched, participants need to sort themselves into groups to actually start working on these hacks. Many participants might be interested in more than one hack, and many might not be sure where they want to contribute. This phase of the process allows participants to go around and chat with those that proposed hacks and decide whether they want to work on that particular project for the week. What : Participants who proposed hacks station themselves at different points throughout the room. In four 7-minute intervals, participants can go through the room and check out a hack. We suggest they aim to answer three questions to themselves: What do I want to work on this week? Can I contribute to this project? Do I want to work with this group? After 7 minutes, participants are invited to switch and explore a different hacks. Those that have already decided on a hack may remain with the group, but are asked not to monopolize the conversation with details of the project, but rather allow newcomers to ask questions as well. It is important to remind participants and project leaders to give each other time to ask questions, and not dominate the discussion. Observations and Feedback : The time people needed was very uneven. It is difficult to keep some projects from just going ahead and starting to work. We don't have a good sense at the moment for how to prevent that from happening. Throughout the Hacking One key component of facilitating the hacking is for a designated facilitator to spend the project time looking out for needs that the groups might have. This involves checking in with the different hack teams regularly and ask questions. How are things going? Is the group missing any expertise? Observe the group interactions and find out whether there are participants who are being (unintentionally or not) excluded from group discussions and work. If so, gently steer the group leaderships towards including these participants, or, if necessary, have a discussion with them in private. Also watch out for participants who might be on their own. Ask them how their week is going, whether they need help connecting to a project. Back off if they indicate that they have some work they wish to do on their own. We generally repeat hack pitches every day after lunch. Some hacks finish early, others fail early (we encourage participants to try out new things, and fail quickly), and so new hacks might emerge during the week that are being pitched. These pitch sessions are also an opportunity for teams to ask for help, if they are missing specific expertise to make progress on their project. Wrap-Up When : short wrap-up sessions during the week as needed (usually not on Mondays, but perhaps Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday), and then a big final wrap-up session on Friday afternoon. Duration : At least 60 minutes, but longer as needed Why : Sharing outcomes of projects is a big part of the workshop. The wrap-ups provide participants to share outcomes: a scientific result, a tutorial, a software tool, a product, a figure, or simply something they've learned. It is particularly important to encourage participants to share projects that failed . Too often, hackathons showcase the most polished and most shiny result, which can reinforce impostor syndrome. It is important to acknowledge that most hacks fail, and that failed hacks are valuable learning experiences that we encourage to be shared. What : Participants are encouraged to submit a wrap-up slide to a shared presentation that summarizes their project. These wrap-up slides are often written during the last lunch break on Friday, or shortly before the wrap-up begins. Each slide includes a title, the participants that contributed, a short summary (1-2 sentences) and what the outcome was. Often, these slides also include an image or a figure that signifies the outcome. For online projects and software, short (1 minute) demos are also permissible. Participants are then encourage to come to the front and summarize their project to the group (in about 1 minute), while the group cheers. Material : shared presentation with a template slide Feedback Feedback is an important component of the hack week. We don't know if something is going wrong if we don't have a mechanism for people to tell us so! It is helpful to stress at the beginning of the week that feedback is always welcome, and that the organizers are always open to receiving feedback. In addition, we have two mechanisms to allow participants to provide feedback: Feedback Box When : every evening after the hack show-and-tell Duration : <5 minutes Why : getting feedback during the week is important for us to react and adjust quickly. Feedback should be anonymous in order for people to be able to give it more openly. Emphasise that this feedback is important to us, because we\u2019re experimenting with different forms of interactions here and are trying to learn what works/doesn\u2019t work. What : Ask participants to take a post-it, and think about these two questions: \u201cWhat did you observe that worked well today? What would you suggest to improve any part of the day?\u201d Participants can add their sticky notes to an anonymous box that the organizers empty and read each evening. Observations and Feedback : This has worked really well for things that needed adjusting on-the-fly during the workshop. The box needs to be somewhere that is easily accessible to participants, and where they won't be easily exposed as writing a feedback note in order to allow them to feel comfortabel submitting especially critical feedback. Participants have also used this to give positive feedback, which is great for us organizers, both in terms of encouraging us and in terms of helping us know what worked well. Feedback Survey When : Ideally directly after the last lunch break (note: you can run this after the workshop ended, but response rates go down significantly) Duration : about 20-30 minutes Why : The survey enables us to get feedback on a broader range of topics related to Astro Hack Week, and enables us to learn about how participants interact at and with the workshop. We have also been tracking different metrics related to learning, open science and reproducibility across the different years and across different types of hack weeks. In addition, the surveys have been invaluable in improving hack weeks and helping us secure funding in the future. What : a survey on Qualtrics (questions to be finished during the week); participants will be asked to fill out this survey (anonymously) after lunch on the last day, in order to get as large a sample as possible. Material : survey on qualtrics (see the GitHub repository associated with this documentation for a template) Observations and Feedback : the survey has been the single most invaluable resource in helping us adjust and improve the workshop every year. We have received an enormous amount of candid and constructive feedback that has helped us design our facilitation strategies better. In addition, Astro Hack Week runs activities, especially with respect to facilitation, as experiments . We re-design parts of the survey every year in a way that allows us to test whether these experiments have positive or negative outcomes.","title":"Astrohackweek Facilitation"},{"location":"Facilitation/AHW-Facilitation/#facilitation-at-astro-hack-week","text":"Astro Hack Week intentionally spreads itself very wide in terms of the participants we admit, and the projects we encourage participants to work on.

These are all based on the following ground rules that we as organizers and facilitators strive to follow and implement during the week: The code of conduct sets the ground rules and minimum standard for all interactions Remind participants repeatedly to think about their interactions, the dynamics within their interactions and groups the space they occupy (relative to others) the distribution of talking time/space to participate Also remind participants to pay particular attention to known dynamics (e.g. with respect to academic seniority, gender, race, \u2026) Do not interrupt speakers (unless they won\u2019t shut up) Encourage questions and give others the benefit of the doubt (don\u2019t tell people \u201cI can\u2019t believe you don\u2019t know this!\u201d or something of the sort) Encourage participants to engage critically with and think about how they interact with others","title":"Facilitation at Astro Hack Week"},{"location":"Facilitation/AHW-Facilitation/#story-board","text":"Add story board here!","title":"Story Board"},{"location":"Facilitation/AHW-Facilitation/#detailed-descriptions-of-activities","text":"","title":"Detailed Descriptions of Activities"},{"location":"Facilitation/AHW-Facilitation/#community-building-impromptu-networking","text":"Description : Impromptu Networking When : Very early on, before the first coffee break (as needed potentially every morning) Duration : ~15-20 minutes Why : Provide a non-threatening environment for first interactions between participants, reduce barriers to interactions, gives them a chance to introduce themselves to others and get to know them in a short while. The short amount of time for each interaction reduces the chance for participants to \u201cpanic\u201d about making a good first impression. Also aims to set the tone for the week and get participants to think about their own goals and obstacles for the week. The responses have to be fast, so they\u2019re designed to be stream-of-consciousness and somewhat unpolished. What : Invite everyone to stand up and spread through the room. Ask them to find someone they haven\u2019t met before. They have 120 seconds to introduce themselves to each other and complete the sentence displayed on the slide (see below for examples). After 120 seconds, ring bell and get participants to switch to a new partner, with a new sentence. Repeat ~7-8 times. Remind participants that 120 seconds is short, and that they\u2019re responsible for giving the other person enough time for their answer. Materials : Bell, slides with sentences to be completed. Sample Statements : What first inspired me in this work is \u2026 One thing I\u2019d like to learn this week is \u2026 A challenge I hope we make progress on is \u2026 I belong at Astro Hack Week because \u2026 Something I am proud of is \u2026 Something I plan to give to this community is ... My hope is that people will experience me as \u2026 Astro Hack Week will be a success for me if \u2026 For fun, I \u2026 In my free time, I like to ... When it\u2019s all said and done, all I want is \u2026 Additional statements, if the exercise is repeated in the mornings throughout the week: Yesterday, I learned that \u2026 In my interactions with others, I particularly enjoyed ... Today, I\u2019d like to try to ... Observations and Feedback : Participants took part in this at Astro Hack Week fairly enthusiastically. Not all used the prompts, some just introduced themselves and chatted about what they planned to do this week, and that's perfectly fine, too. There were two important observations and feedback that are relevant for future uses of this activity: Some of the statements might be triggering for participants with social anxiety and mental health issues (e.g. in the first version of this activity one of the prompts read \"A voice I need to stop listening to is ...\"). We've since tried to eliminate those statements, and remain attentive to feedback regarding prompts that might make our participants uncomfortable. One issue with this activity is that 50 people all talking to one another at the same time can get very loud! Ideally, do this activity outside if weather permits, or in a space that allows participants to spread out and that doesn't echo too much. Something that we haven't solved very well so far is how this exercise might work for participants with mobility issues. Because it requires standing and moving about, this might unintentionally exclude some participants. There could be a variant where this exercise involves paired chairs, and only some participants move about. The invitation would be for roughly half of the participants to stand up and find a partner, while the remainder stays seated. In either case, however, it's useful to get participants to move away from the tables they might normally be sitting at and away from their computers, if possible.","title":"Community Building: Impromptu Networking"},{"location":"Facilitation/AHW-Facilitation/#introducing-and-framing-astro-hack-week","text":"When : At the beginning of the week, right after the Impromptu Networking Duration : About 30 minutes Why : Many participants come in with just a vague idea of what Astro Hack Week is and what its goals are. This introduction aims to give participants an overview of the workshop, the practical logistics (schedule, bathrooms, lunches, social events etc.), and especially the rules and expectations for working together and for building an inclusive learning environment. What : About a half-hour presentation by the organizers, covering the elements and structure of the workshop, logistics, the code of conduct and other aspects of working together for the week. At Astro Hack Week, it has been important to us not only to reinforce that the code of conduct is to be followed at all times (both during the workshop itself and social times outside of it), but actively goes into detail how we want participants to behave and interact with one another. This includes welcoming questions and providing useful answers, experimenting with Astro Hack Week itself, trying out something new, listening to each other, respecting each other's pronouns, being kind to one another, and being open to learn about one another, both in terms of technical knowledge as well as from other people's lived experiences. This discussion also includes a note on impostor phenomenon, which we've found to be prevalent at Astro Hack Week.

Because data visualization is one of the less technically complicated topics, and because it allows for many opportunities to practice group interactions, we chose it as a vehicle to also model and practice inclusive group work with our participants. We guided our participants through a series of group activities that allowed them to self-discover important data visualization principles and put them into practice, while also providing them with structures to help them with the project work later.","title":"Building Positive Learning Environments Through a Data Visualization Tutorial"},{"location":"Facilitation/AHW-Facilitation/#community-building-1-2-4-all-for-data-visualization","text":"Description : 1-2-4-all When : at the start of the data visualization tutorial Duration : 20 minutes (silent reflection: 2 minutes, pairs: 4 minutes, groups of 4: 6 minutes, whole group: 8 minutes; see also feedback + observations below ) Why : Best practices and rules are most easily accepted when they are grounded in the students\u2019 own experiences. Especially with data visualization, more than other fields, there is likely a lot of expertise scattered through the room already, and most participants, even students, are likely to have an intuitive sense of whether a particular visualization is effective at communicating information. This exercise is aimed at co-creating best practices for effective data visualization. The secondary goal is to give participants a structure and a framework for group interactions and working in teams, which they may adopt for the free-form hacking later during the day/week, and reinforce good practices for communicating and cooperating. What : Invite participants to sit down next to someone they don\u2019t know. Each participant gets one data visualization to look at: some sample visualizations are fairly competent at communicating information, some are not. Each participant is then asked to answer three questions (see below) in silent reflection (2 minutes). In the next step, participants are grouped in pairs, and discuss their answers, co-creating a common set of best practices (4 minutes). In the third step, groups of four discuss the common set of best practices and (6 minutes) rank them by importance. In groups of four, a pen or crayon will serve as a talking object. Only the person with the object speaks, and each person mentions one rule, then passes on the object. One person has to be a note-taker (for the shared online document). Participants should invite the most junior person to speak first, but they\u2019re free to say \u201cpass\u201d and let someone else begin. Finally, each team shares a practice with the entire group, which a note-taker records in the shared online document. Once each team has had a chance to speak, if there are further best practices, we go through the groups again and allow each group to mention another best practice. Material : pens/crayons, print-outs of data visualizations, set-up of a shared online document Questions : What information does this data visualization convey What does this data visualization do well in communicating information? Can you think of ways in which you would improve this data visualization? What general rules can you derive for communicating information visually? Observations and Feedback : 20 minutes is way too short for this exercise, partly because participants require more time to take in the visualization and answer the questions, but also because they are excited to share their conclusions both in pairs and groups of four. For the second iteration of this exercise, we restricted ourselves to just two data visualizations, and gave roughly half the participants each. I think 45 minutes is a better time estimate for this exercise in total (5 minutes silent contemplation, 10 minutes in pairs, 15 minutes in groups of four, 15 minute for summary with the group). One suggestion has been to give this exercise more practical structure by providing participants a page with 4 quadrants, each signifying one of the questions. The participants are then asked to note down their observations in each quadrant, and circle one observation in each quadrant that stood out to them.","title":"Community Building: 1-2-4 All for Data Visualization"},{"location":"Facilitation/AHW-Facilitation/#community-building-improve-a-data-visualization","text":"When : In general, the 1-2-4-all exercise above is followed by a bit of a lecture-style introduction into some concepts that give the participants a bit of practical background on some of the visualization principles they co-created (e.g. pre-attentive processing, Gestalt psychology). Following this, the participants get the opportunity to take an existing data visualization and improve upon it. Duration : 60 minutes Why : Learning new principles and ideas functions best through practice and trying it out. In this activity, participants will work in teams of 3-4 to take an existing data visualization and improve upon it visually. Again, this structure aims to give participants a framework for how to interact in teams and learn some of these principles of constructive interaction in a non-threatening setting. What : Participants will be asked to team up in groups of 3-4 and pick a data visualization. It can be a plot they have made (voluntary!), or they can pick one of the ones that the instructors bring along. During the first ten minutes, participants identify improvements to be made in the existing visualization, using the same rules as during the group-phase of the 1-2-4-all: each person gets to say one thing, then passes the talking pen off to the next person. A person who would not like to add anything can say \u201cpass\u201d and pass on the pen. Participants should invite the most junior person to speak first, but they\u2019re free to say \u201cpass\u201d and let someone else begin. One person takes notes. Once all the possible improvements have been put onto paper, participants vote on their top 5 improvements (each gets 3 votes), and start collecting ideas for how to improve in a similar manner as before. They take a piece of paper and pin it to the wall, then use the crayons to draw out a sketch of the new visualization. If there is time, they can attempt to create it on a computer, but emphasis here is on creating a prototype together on paper. During the last 15 minutes, a member of each team will share the results with the rest of the groups. Notes : Some of the design elements of this exercise were chosen particularly to enable positive group collaboration and facilitate the best learning outcome. Do not pick figures from your own field as bad examples for visualizations, unless you can be absolutely sure that the author is not in the room (for example, by choosing your own). Having a figure you might have spent weeks on publicly dissected without being warned that this might be happening is absolutely terrifying and has a chilling effect. You do not want this to happen. Thankfully, the internet is full of terrible, professionally produced visualizations for you to pick from. The exercise explicitly uses crayons on paper, because with computer-based exercises, the group can be too easily side-tracked into specific questions of how to plot one particular thing with that specific plotting library. In addition, team members might have different skill levels in computer-based visualization, which may lead to some participants programming, while others sit at the sidelines being excluded from participating. Secondly, we chose to pin paper to the wall specifically because it means that participants are all facing the same way, toward a common goal. This is markedly different from paper that's spread on a table, with people standing around. In the latter case, participants disagreeing with someone else's suggestion do so while facing them, which can feel more confrontative than while everyone is facing the same way towards the paper on the wall. Material : pens/crayons, print-outs of data visualizations, large sheets of paper, tape, empty walls Observations and Feedback : Expect ~10 minutes to pick a figure, ~30 minutes to prototype a figure, and another ~15 minutes to collect the results (depending on group size, of course; this was for ~50 participants). Participants really enjoyed both the figures and the crayons. It made this much more playful and much less intimidating than it would otherwise have been (and some participants noted that specifically in the feedback). One out of ten groups chose to use their own figure instead of one of those I provided. Putting the (empty) posters on the wall was really helpful, I think, because people started talking about the poster, rather than toward each other (which suggested might be less confrontational). We also observed that many participants who didn\u2019t want to share their group\u2019s conclusions during the first exercise participated enthusiastically in the drawing, so it seemed to have succeeded in getting people to interact.","title":"Community Building: Improve a Data Visualization"},{"location":"Facilitation/AHW-Facilitation/#facilitating-the-hacking","text":"The project work component of Astro Hack Week requires careful facilitation in particular, because it is otherwise very free-form and can be very intimidating to new participants and those who are introverted and/or shy. In particular pitching potential projects to the entire group requires a lot of self-confidence in one's ideas and ability to convey them in less than a minute. We start this part of the workshop with a short introduction into what a hack is, and the characteristics of a good hack (see also intro slides linked above). We alert participants before the workshop as well, and encourage them to start submitting hack ideas to a shared document (though not many do). I think in the future, it would be worthwhile to have a hack development workshop before actually going into the activities described below, but we haven't tried that out yet. The goal here would be to get those with hack ideas to fill out a hack template that asks relevant questions about the project, to be answered before the project can commence.","title":"Facilitating the Hacking"},{"location":"Facilitation/AHW-Facilitation/#hack-pitch-preparation-impromptu-networking","text":"When : Directly after the intro about hacking or a hack development workshop Duration : 6 minutes Why : Standing up in front of the entire group and sharing an idea is a daunting task. Some participants might not be sure whether their idea is something they really want to work on, or whether it\u2019s good enough to share. The round of impromptu networking is an opportunity for participants to test out their idea on a small number of individuals first, refine how they present the core objective of their idea, and decide whether they would like to share it with the group. What : Impromptu networking in this iteration only involves only a single question: \u201cWhat is it you\u2019d like to pursue this week?\u201d Each participant is invited to find another person, ideally one they haven\u2019t interacted with yet. Within two minutes, they answer this question to each other, either in the form of a hack idea, or something else they\u2019d like to achieve. This is more free-form in the sense that the other person can ask questions and it can be more of a conversation.

What : Each participant gets the opportunity to stand up in front and share their hack idea with the group. Ideally, one would start with 3-4 experienced participants to model how this is best done, then asks some of the newer participants to share their ideas, then go back to some experienced participants. During the hack development phase, participants could also write down short descriptions on a set of slides, or fill out paper versions of the hack template. Those that don't want to stand up in front of the group could ask the organizers to pitch either from the slides or from the shared notes. Material : Potentially slides with hack pitches, a microphone Observations and Feedback : Pitching hacks is scary for some participants, and we haven't yet found a way to lower the barrier for those that are uncertain about stepping in front of the group to pitch their idea.

Many participants might be interested in more than one hack, and many might not be sure where they want to contribute. This phase of the process allows participants to go around and chat with those that proposed hacks and decide whether they want to work on that particular project for the week. What : Participants who proposed hacks station themselves at different points throughout the room. In four 7-minute intervals, participants can go through the room and check out a hack. We suggest they aim to answer three questions to themselves: What do I want to work on this week? Can I contribute to this project? Do I want to work with this group? After 7 minutes, participants are invited to switch and explore a different hacks. Those that have already decided on a hack may remain with the group, but are asked not to monopolize the conversation with details of the project, but rather allow newcomers to ask questions as well. It is important to remind participants and project leaders to give each other time to ask questions, and not dominate the discussion. Observations and Feedback : The time people needed was very uneven. It is difficult to keep some projects from just going ahead and starting to work. We don't have a good sense at the moment for how to prevent that from happening.","title":"Hack Sorting"},{"location":"Facilitation/AHW-Facilitation/#throughout-the-hacking","text":"One key component of facilitating the hacking is for a designated facilitator to spend the project time looking out for needs that the groups might have. This involves checking in with the different hack teams regularly and ask questions. How are things going? Is the group missing any expertise? Observe the group interactions and find out whether there are participants who are being (unintentionally or not) excluded from group discussions and work. If so, gently steer the group leaderships towards including these participants, or, if necessary, have a discussion with them in private. Also watch out for participants who might be on their own. Ask them how their week is going, whether they need help connecting to a project. Back off if they indicate that they have some work they wish to do on their own. We generally repeat hack pitches every day after lunch. Some hacks finish early, others fail early (we encourage participants to try out new things, and fail quickly), and so new hacks might emerge during the week that are being pitched. These pitch sessions are also an opportunity for teams to ask for help, if they are missing specific expertise to make progress on their project.","title":"Throughout the Hacking"},{"location":"Facilitation/AHW-Facilitation/#wrap-up","text":"When : short wrap-up sessions during the week as needed (usually not on Mondays, but perhaps Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday), and then a big final wrap-up session on Friday afternoon.

The wrap-ups provide participants to share outcomes: a scientific result, a tutorial, a software tool, a product, a figure, or simply something they've learned. It is particularly important to encourage participants to share projects that failed . Too often, hackathons showcase the most polished and most shiny result, which can reinforce impostor syndrome. It is important to acknowledge that most hacks fail, and that failed hacks are valuable learning experiences that we encourage to be shared. What : Participants are encouraged to submit a wrap-up slide to a shared presentation that summarizes their project. These wrap-up slides are often written during the last lunch break on Friday, or shortly before the wrap-up begins. Each slide includes a title, the participants that contributed, a short summary (1-2 sentences) and what the outcome was. Often, these slides also include an image or a figure that signifies the outcome. For online projects and software, short (1 minute) demos are also permissible.

This is reported out to the full group in the hopes that other teams might be able to offer advice or resources in an area where a team might be stuck.","title":"Checking In"},{"location":"Facilitation/checking-in/#checking-in","text":"Whereas the code of conduct and norms of behavior establish the initial conditions for a positive learning experience, regular check-ins help to sustain those conditions across the duration of the event.

Hackweeks are a relatively new learning model, so participants may arrive on the first day not knowing quite what to expect. Careful planning of the opening session can help alleviate participant anxiety by establishing a code of conduct and norms of behavior, and setting intentions around building a welcoming learning environment. We detail below a variety of topics and activities that can be included in the opening session. We have experimented with opening sessions lasting as long as 1.5 hours. The length you choose will depend on the total number of activities planned. Welcoming Remarks Usually the event begins with brief opening remarks, often by the lead organizer of the hackweek. Topics in the welcoming remarks may include: acknowledging the substantial time commitment participants are making to attend the event thanking organizers, tutorial leads and guest speakers acknowledging sources of funding speaking briefly about the history, formation and overall mission of the hackweek model talking through logistics of the room setup, timing and location of breaks and meals and the overall schedule of the event Code of Conduct The code of conduct defines the rules and acceptable behaviors of participants during the event. All hackweeks post their code of conduct online ( example code of conduct ) and require participants to have read and agree to these terms before they register for the event. During the opening session we draw everyone's attention to the code of conduct again as a way to emphasize its importance. We recommend providing a handout with the code of conduct listed in writing, and talking through the various options participants have to report a code of conduct violation. Imposter Phenomenon It is common across all levels of technical and academic endeavors to feel as if one's existing knowledge and skill set is below the level of others in their community, and that one doesn't really belong at a particular event. This is a particularly acute challenge at hackweeks where we welcome everyone from beginners to experts, and where we explore tools and approaches that may have just been invented by the open source community (see this blog post for some examples). Because of the complex, rapidly changing nature of data science studies, feeling like an imposter is an extremely common and normal experience for people across all levels of experience. Therefore we prefer to call this experience the \"Imposter Phenomenon\", rather than the more commonly used \"Imposter Syndrome\", because we feel the term \"Syndrome\" suggests a pathology, which goes counter to our assertion that this is a common and normal experience. As shown in our detailed hackweek case studies, different hackweeks have worked to mitigate Imposter Phenomenon in different ways. But common to all of our approaches is the creation of a community space that not only makes it safe to fail, but actually encourages it. We aim to convey the idea that data science studies are complex and require a series of experiments, some of which will succeed, and some of which will fail. We gain as much from the success as the failures as we learn to amplify success and avoid the path to failure in our future experiments.","title":"Opening the Event"},{"location":"Facilitation/event-introduction/#event-introduction","text":"The opening session provides organizers with a unique opportunity to set the overall tone of the event.

Research shows that this collaborative work increases the liklihood for innovation and creativity. Our wiki pages provide in-depth project guidelines and details on project management . Here we offer ideas on how to facilitate the project work so that participants can make the best use of their time. Forming Project Teams One of the biggest challenges in getting started on the projects is deciding which project to join. One approach to pitching and selecting projects that has worked well across multiple hackweeks is described below. Introduction to Projects and Hacking We begin with a short presentation describing the purpose of the projects. We remind participants that this is not an activity that will be graded, and that learning the process of collaborative software development is more important than generating any specific products or outcomes at the end of the week. We talk through the various roles and responsibilities of project team and data science leads, as well as of each individual in the group. We also describe the appropriate scope and depth of the projects, and talk about the collaboration tools to be used during the week. Generating Project Ideas Participants are now given some time to brainstorm on project ideas. We use either Impromptu Networking or 1-2-4-All , using an invitation such as, \"What data science challenge would you like to make progress on this week?\", or \"What problem could this group make progress on in the coming days?\". This session should last 20-30 minutes, giving people enough time to share ideas and gain additional clarity on an idea that might have been brewing for some time. Project Pitching After having a series of conversations we invite anyone who is ready to pitch an idea to come to the front of the room. First we have an instructor model the project pitch, which should be succinct, clear, and have a duration under one minute. At the end of the pitch we ask the person for a one word project name, which we then write on a large sticky note. One instructor also takes notes on a whiteboard so everyone can keep track of ideas being presented. Team Formation Each person who pitched an idea now takes their large sticky note and finds an area in the room to post the note, effectively setting up a temporary station where additional conversations can be conducted. Participants are then invited to walk to any station that interests them so that they can find out more information. This structure is a condensed version of Shift and Share and generally lasts 20-30 minutes. Often during this process, small teams will recognize areas of overlap with other teams and may decide to merge. Or, teams that have a lot of interest might split into a series of smaller teams. Generally the optimum team size is 4-7 people, but we have had smaller and larger teams that have worked as well. At this time, anyone who is still looking for a team can consult with an organizer and have additional discussions to aid their decision process. Team Introductions Once teams are formed they gather together at a chosen location to begin working together. We invite each team to begin by getting to know each other. Waterhackweek accomplished this by having \"Participant Bios\" prepared in advance that included a picture of the participant, their name and institution, and space to write about their background and coding experience. Two additional prompts on the page were: \"I want to contribute...\" and \"I want to focus my learning on...\". These forms were then shared within each team as a way to accelerate connections and minimize the liklihood that individuals get left out of group activities. Developing Positive Team Interactions The first few hours of a team's interactions can be critical in setting the tone for effective communication and collaboration. What often occurs is teams begin diving into the details, perhaps out of an excitement for the material they are working on. Or, there may be one team member who is particularly vocal and who may, intentionally or not, dominate the early phases of the project time. We recommend that the data science and project team leads should play an active role in facilitating the development of team interactions that include everyone on the team, and that help people rapidly find project activites that align with their skills.","title":"Pitching Hacks/Projects"},{"location":"Facilitation/pitching-hacks/#hackweek-projects","text":"The purpose of hackweek projects is for participants to gain hands-on experience in working together on a well-defined problem.

The different hack weeks have different approaches to this: for example, Astro Hack Week tends to provide less structure that allows for more free-form work, while Geo Hack Week offers a more structured approach, where project teams stay together the entire week and projects have designated Project Leads and Data Science Leads. A Note on the terminology of \"hacking\" In recent years, hackathons have become popular in the tech industry and beyond. They often span anywhere between 24 to 48 hours, where participants are expected to work continuously with little to no sleep on solutions to a specific problem. They often involve a competition for prize money (or equivalent) for the best solution, and companies are known to use them as recruiting events. While popular among groups, many people have rightfully criticized that model on the grounds of promoting an unhealthy and exclusionary culture, where coding is prioritized over physical health and there is tacit acceptance that only those can participate who can devote a full 24 or 48 hours to the hackathon (i.e. have for example no childcare responsibilities, or no medical reasons that prevent them from sitting in front of a computer for long periods of time). In addition, women, non-binary people and members of other underrepresented groups in science and the technology sector have traditionally been underrepresented at hackathons, and many have made an explicit choice not to attend any following negative experiences, some of which are summarized in this blog post . As organizers of events called \"hack weeks\", we are generally concerned that the name of the event might prevent some researchers to not apply in the first place, and that this might be especially true for researchers from demographics that have traditionally been excluded (explicitly or implicitly) from hackathons. At Astro Hack Week, the organizing committee has a discussion every year whether to rename the event. For now, our decision has been to try and reclaim the term \"hacking\" and put it into a more positive context: one where we aim to make the event inclusive and welcoming, and actively counteract some of the negative dynamics often present in the traditional hackathon model. Key differences between our hack weeks and the traditional hackathon model are that we strive to organize them during regular business hours to accommodate participants with care responsibilities, offer care grants, emphasize the problem-solving and community-centric (rather than competitive) nature of our events. However, we continue to have this discussion, and may come to a different conclusion in the future. It is also worth noting that hackathon organizers are increasingly aware of the problems with the hackathon model, and are working to counter-act them by designing events that focus on communities of colour , emphasize empathy and an experience-centric design , and provide e.g. inclusive design guides . What is a Hack The terms \"hack\" and \"hacking\" can lead to some confusion, especially among people outside the data science, tech and open source communities, where \"hacking\" is usually synonymous with illegally gaining entry to a computer system. This is not what we mean by \"hack\". In our definition, a hack is a small project with a clear goal, which should be completed by the time initially allocated to it. Because the problems that researchers think about tend to be complex, defining such a project often requires significant simplification , or taking a quick approach to solving that problem. The idea of a hackathon, in our definition, is to foster the idea of hacking as a fun, interactive and welcoming environment to explore and experiment with new ideas, concepts and methods. Because hacks are time-bounded, they should be results-driven , which means it is important for those proposing a hack to plan a little in advance. At the same time, results-driven does not necessarily mean successful : in our hack weeks we always aim to foster an environment where a negative result is celebrated equally as a result that helps the community learn about how not to approach a problem. In our hack weeks, we aim to foster a sense of joy and learning through experimentation, and hacks are often prototypes or initial explorations that may lead to larger and longer-term projects, rather than one-off solutions to a particular challenge. Different hack weeks have a somewhat different outlook on what kinds of projects specifically are \"hacks\": for example, Geo Hack Week explicitly focuses on outcomes that involve computer code, while Astro Hack Week considers a wider range of projects as hacks: these can be policy documents and white papers, a new logo for a group or software project, or even sowing projects, to name but a few examples. In addition, Astro Hack Week runs a community hack day as part of Astro Hack Week every year: this day is set aside explicitly for participants of Astro Hack Week to work on projects that benefit the astronomy community as a whole. Setting Up Projects Many participants may have an idea for a hack, but may not have participated in a hack week before, and thus will appreciate guidance on how to set up a functional project, how to define time-bounded outcomes and milestones. At Astro Hack Week, we use a Hack Template to guide participants through the process of defining hacks. GeoHackWeek asks the teams to designate a team lead and data science lead, and start a GitHub repository with important project information in its README. While at Astro Hack Week researchers ideally come with a project they have thought of in terms of the provided template, Geo Hack Week allows teams to form and then guides the teams through a structure to clarify the key problem as well as the most promising approaches to solving that problem. In both cases, guidance to participants includes defining the key problem in terms of why it is important to solve that particular problem, and to write down the specific questions that are to be asked. In addition, we ask participants to identify the proposed methods and tools used to solve it, as well as what skills and knowledge from the participants might be helpful to achieve the goal. Organizers should encourage participants proposing projects to think carefully about how early-stage learners can meaningfully contribute to their projects. Our hack weeks often include learners with little to no technical knowledge, which puts them at risk of exclusion in an environment dominated by researchers experienced in writing code and developing new and advanced methods. In this context, it can also be helpful to encourage projects that don't directly require advanced technical skills, especially if they are proposed by those participants themselves. For example, Astro Hack Week has seen projects e.g. where a group of learners taught themselves a particular technical skill through generally available tutorials, then wrote an astronomy-themed tutorial on that skill as part of their hack. Similarly, early-career participants at Astro Hack Week have hacked for example on knowledge resources for graduate school applications and creative projects like designing the logo for a software package. Checking in with the Team For organizers, it is important to periodically check in with the teams. This can happen in a structured way (e.g. Geo Hack Week has a formal check-in with guided activities on Day 3), or informally (Astro Hack Week has one or more facilitators move through the room, observe the team work process and step in with advice or requests as needed). It is especially important to look out for participants who are very junior, whose potential to meaningfully contribute might get lost as more experienced team members rapidly prototype complex solutions. Including early-stage learners and ensuring that they can meaningfully contribute to the projects (for example by trying out a new method and finding bugs, writing a tutorial for other early-stage learners, etc.) and that their contributions are valued fully and equally by the team is an important facilitation task during project work.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Hacking/Hacks-Intro/#how-to-set-up-hacks-and-projects","text":"One of the key components for a successful hack week is to guide participants through the process of setting up and working on hacks. The different hack weeks have different approaches to this: for example, Astro Hack Week tends to provide less structure that allows for more free-form work, while Geo Hack Week offers a more structured approach, where project teams stay together the entire week and projects have designated Project Leads and Data Science Leads.","title":"How to Set Up Hacks and Projects"},{"location":"Hacking/Hacks-Intro/#a-note-on-the-terminology-of-hacking","text":"In recent years, hackathons have become popular in the tech industry and beyond. They often span anywhere between 24 to 48 hours, where participants are expected to work continuously with little to no sleep on solutions to a specific problem. They often involve a competition for prize money (or equivalent) for the best solution, and companies are known to use them as recruiting events. While popular among groups, many people have rightfully criticized that model on the grounds of promoting an unhealthy and exclusionary culture, where coding is prioritized over physical health and there is tacit acceptance that only those can participate who can devote a full 24 or 48 hours to the hackathon (i.e. have for example no childcare responsibilities, or no medical reasons that prevent them from sitting in front of a computer for long periods of time). In addition, women, non-binary people and members of other underrepresented groups in science and the technology sector have traditionally been underrepresented at hackathons, and many have made an explicit choice not to attend any following negative experiences, some of which are summarized in this blog post . As organizers of events called \"hack weeks\", we are generally concerned that the name of the event might prevent some researchers to not apply in the first place, and that this might be especially true for researchers from demographics that have traditionally been excluded (explicitly or implicitly) from hackathons. At Astro Hack Week, the organizing committee has a discussion every year whether to rename the event. For now, our decision has been to try and reclaim the term \"hacking\" and put it into a more positive context: one where we aim to make the event inclusive and welcoming, and actively counteract some of the negative dynamics often present in the traditional hackathon model. Key differences between our hack weeks and the traditional hackathon model are that we strive to organize them during regular business hours to accommodate participants with care responsibilities, offer care grants, emphasize the problem-solving and community-centric (rather than competitive) nature of our events. However, we continue to have this discussion, and may come to a different conclusion in the future. It is also worth noting that hackathon organizers are increasingly aware of the problems with the hackathon model, and are working to counter-act them by designing events that focus on communities of colour , emphasize empathy and an experience-centric design , and provide e.g. inclusive design guides .","title":"A Note on the terminology of \"hacking\""},{"location":"Hacking/Hacks-Intro/#what-is-a-hack","text":"The terms \"hack\" and \"hacking\" can lead to some confusion, especially among people outside the data science, tech and open source communities, where \"hacking\" is usually synonymous with illegally gaining entry to a computer system.

What goals and objectives are the organizers pursuing by organizing this hack week? Are these goals personal goals or community-level goals? Some community-level goals might include bringing more data science methods into the community, building a cohort of like-minded researchers, making progress on a specific tool, software package or data set, and building a set of tools to address one specific or multiple scientific challenges. Our hack weeks are very non-uniform in their goals and objectives. For example, Astro Hack Week pitches itself as widely as possible: while the focus of the tutorials is often on new methods and tools, any broadly astronomy-themed hack is welcome. This could include developing new software, but could also mean providing a document of resources for teaching, designing a new logo for an organization, or building tutorials for computational and astronomy subjects. Geo Hack Week, in contrast is more narrow in scope and focuses on improving computational and programming literacy in the Geosciences community, and on working directly on software tools that address geophysical challenges. The IceSat-2 Hack Week is even more narrowly scoped on developing next-generation tools for a new space mission. It is worth pointing out explicitly that none of those is better than the other. They are designed differently to solve different challenges in different communities, and the hack week model easily accomodates different goals that the organizers might pursue. In any of these cases, however, it is important to be clear among the organizers what those goals and objectives actually are, and perhaps spell them out, for example in a mission statement. They form the basis of much of the subsequent organization, ranging from questions of whether participants require pre-knowledge during participant selection to facilitating the hacks themselves. Ideally, an organizing committee should start with the question: What are we trying to achieve? From there, one can write down a set of big-picture themes that provide the basis for more specific goals, as well as actions that help achieve those goals. In this context, it is also helpful for organizers to discuss and settle on a set of core values that the organizers aim to follow in their organization of the workshop. These values will align with the overall mission of hack weeks and will represent the specific dimensions of that mission that the organizers wish to amplify, and could include values like kindness, collaborativeness, and attentiveness, to name a few. The values defined in this stage might in part form the basis for developing the code of conduct, and are helpful when framing facilitation strategies. Some hackathons have also experienced with user stories in order to build a narrative around goals and objectives, and to identify problems and barriers for participants in achieving those goals. User stories in this context are short narratives centred around hypothetical participants, and describe for example what such a participant might tell their colleague or supervisor after the event. Our hack weeks have never implemented this approach, but some are considering it for future iterations. For Astro Hack Week, the goals generally include: improve the data science literacy within the astronomy community build a cohort of like-minded researchers and allow them to build a community improve the representation of researchers from minority backgrounds within the astronomy and data science communities promote best practices related to open science and reproducibility within the astronomy community help researchers build open-source software allow researchers to formulate, implement and rapidly test new ideas allow researchers to have fun with projects they care about, but that often are not part of their day-to-day work provide a venue for work that directly helps the astronomy community as a whole Target Audience and Scoping to Specific Communities Most directly related to the goals and objectives is the question of who the target audience for the workshop is. In our experience, the question of what the goals and objectives are arises naturally during the selection process of participants. In order to understand what a cohort matched to the goals and objectives of the workshop looks like, one first must understand what those goals are . With broadly scoped workshops like Astro Hack Week or Geo Hack Week, one might start from those goals and objectives and then ask what the target audience for these goals is. For example, a workshop that is very heavily focused on software development might wish to set minimum requirements for coding ability at the onset (though one important consideration in this process should be if the target audience as defined might systematically disadvantage candidate from specific backgrounds). Some organizers might wish to follow this process the other way around: perhaps the organizers have a very specific audience in mind that they wish to serve, and then work to identify specific needs of that community in order to set goals and expectations for the workshop. For example, the IceSat-2 hack week was centred around the community expected to take advantage of the new data sets this mission creates. The organizers identified a lack of openly available tools to this end, and designed the hack week specifically to provide a venue to start projects around the creation of those tools. In practice, setting goals and defining a target audience are interlinked. Even committees approaching the problem from the goals perspective will often have identified a persistent need in the target audience first, that they feel they can start addressing by organizing the workshop. While many of the objectives for Astro Hack Week are related to data science and its place within the astronomy community, the target audience is intentionally kept broad, and includes researchers from both astronomy and other research fields, academia and industry, early-career and senior researchers. The guiding principle is that great ideas and innovation may come from anywhere, and that these ideas may or may not involve code or data science. Astro Hack Week strives to provide a venue for many types of ideas and projects, and thus imposes very few requirements on potential participants. Advertising Once you have defined your workshop goals, and identified a target audience, how do you reach that target audience in practice? A website is a useful tool to convey information about the workshop, as are announcements via e-mail or social media. Crafting both the website and announcements carefully is important here: the announcement should be clear about the goals and objectives, but also share the values of the workshop and the community and environment that the organizers strive to create. Often researchers will read announcements and websites quite closely to figure out whether the event aligns with their interests and values. Especially because hackathons as events have negative connotations with some groups of people, communicating the community-focused and collaborative nature of the hack weeks is important to reach researchers who might otherwise feel discouraged from applying. It should be obvious, but is worth pointing out explicitly, that an event should only be advertised as inclusive if the organizers are committed and are taking active steps to make the event inclusive. Asking researchers to spend their valuable time, money and effort to attend a workshop that in practice might be exclusionary to them or actively harmful to their well-being and/or careers should not ever happen. In practical terms, like with other conferences, we largely rely on traditional channels of sharing conference announcements: personal networks, professional societies and social media like Twitter. Because Astro Hack Week also has a mandate of improving the participation of minority researchers in data science research in astronomy, we also reach out to community groups that serve these researchers.","title":"Objectives"},{"location":"Objectives/Objectives-and-Goals/#objectives-and-goals-of-a-hack-week","text":"Key to the hack week organization process--and perhaps the process of organizing any meeting---is a clear understanding what the hack week is for .

Once topic of a hackweek is formulated, the process of gathering together other committee memebers should begin, ideally no later than 12 months prior to the event. Below we list the typical roles across an organizing committee. We note that for some events, certain roles might not be considered an integral part of the formal organizing committee, such as tutorial leads. There are advantages and disadvantages to including everyone at the decision making level, and these should be considered by the lead organizers early in the process. Some advantages include an increased sense of ownership that results in organizers putting forth their best effort in designing and delivering content, and a broadening of the collective wisdom of the organizing committee around important decisions due to the presence of a diversity of perspectives. Early career faculty and researchers also often report that being recognized at the organizational level helps their resumes when it comes to applying for jobs. Disadvantages include the fact that as the committee size increases, the process of making decisions can become more challenging. It can also become difficult to include everyone in important decision making meetings when the organizing committee spans multiple time zones. Tutorial Leads Generally the largest group of organizers are focused around development and delivery of data science tutorials. Responsibilities include: polling their respective communities to determine what are the community needs around data science education talking to open source software developers to connect with the most up-to-date tools and libraries available building a set of learning objectives, designing and creating a tutorial review the content of a tutorial and integrate it with themes of other tutorials offered in the event work with cloud computing organizers to ensure all the tools are in place for participants to run interactive tutorials practice the delivery of tutorials in advance of the event Additional guidelines on the roles and responsibilities for tutorial leads can be found on the Geo Hack Week wiki page for tutorial leads . logistics coordinator The logistics coordinator plays an important role in event planning and implementation. A partial list of their responsibilities has been compiled on the Geo Hack Week administrative planning repository as a set of GitHub issues. (ask Jane for one of her checklists) Project/Hack coordinator A project/hack coordinator helps to guide the formation and smooth functioning of projects and hacking during the event. Responsibilities include: guiding a team in defining project goals that can be reasonably accomplished during the week setting benchmarks for team activities and checking-in regularly with team members on progress helping to ensure that everyone gets a chance to participate in group work in some way enabling and encourage participants to solve problems in a way that builds confidence supporting the project scientist in establishing reproducible workflows mentoring individual team members requesting additional support working with the team to navigate technical or team dynamic challenges Cloud computing resource organizers For many events we use centralized cloud computing resources, for example JupyterHub deployed on a commercial cloud platform. This requires someone who can deploy these resources and be available to assist with any troubleshooting during the event. overall coordination There may be one or several people considered overall leaders of the event. These are often the people who initiated the idea of the hack week in the first place. Within a more traditional organizational structure, there may be one person responsible for most of the decision making and ensuring everthing gets done, however this can place a significant burden on a single person. In a more distributed leadership model, multiple people have autonomous decision making power informed and supported by cross-team communications. Responsibilities of overall coordinators include: providing the impetus and energy for initiating and moving the event forward calling meetings, establishing effective channels of communication and linking up the right people identifying duplication of effort and increasing team efficiencies acting as the main point of contact for outreach and communcations outside of the group writing proposals and seeking funding leading efforts to recruit members of the organizing committee keeping an eye on the big picture to be sure everyone is on schedule leading challenging discussions and mediating conflicts Recruiting an organizing committee Depending on the size of the group who initiate the idea of a hack week, it may or may not be necessary to put time into recruiting others to assist as members of the organizing committee. In the case of an institution such as a university department starting a hack week, there may be enough local administrative support and tutorial leads without needing to find additional people. In other cases, for example our recent ICESat-2 hack week aimed at building software tools for a new NASA mission, we wanted to have participation from a broad community, especially members of the satellite's science team who had already begun to build software tools. In this case a broader range of recruitment efforts were necessary. For hack weeks that recur over multiple years, one might also recruit enthusiastic participants as organizers for subsequent events, as has been common for Astro Hack Week Because the organizing committee has a responsibility to model the principles and norms of behavior we aim to promote at a hack week, it is important to find people whose values align with this mission. Similarly, we want the organizing committee to be as diverse as possible to maximize the number of different perspectives in the room, and to offer role models to an equally diverse range of hack week participants. Here are some of general principles for recruiting a diverse and engaged organizing committee: Designate one person or a small committee to be responsible for recruitment. Among this group, build a list of potential recruitees who would be considered good organizers and who would benefit from being on the commitee in some way. Try to think not only of the most visible community leaders within your network, but also individuals from diverse communities who may offer different perspectives. This list may also contain names of people who have approached the hack week organizers with an intention to participate. For recruitees who are completely new to the group and who have not experienced a hack week, initiate a 30 minute meeting with the lead coordinator(s). Begin the meeting with a review of the hack week mission and ask the recruitee to offer some reflections on how their participation would serve to support that mission. This meeting is also an opportunity to share ideas on potential ways the recruitee can get involved. An e-mail invitation to both new and continuing potential committee members is an effective way to establish an organizational structure early in the process. The purpose of the message is to: thank the pontential committee member for considering this activity provide links to logistics information (event location, timing, travel arrangements) provide a reminder of the roles, responsibilities and potential time commitment for this activity offer to have this person's information included on the hack week website For some hack weeks we have used the participant application form as an efficient way to initially assemble an organizing committee. Committee members will be asked to fill out this form anyhow, for the sake of assessing our overall team diversity. In this process we also ask them to provide details on the open-ended questions about how they would like to be involved on an administrative level. Recognizing contributions from committee memebers Hack week organizing committees often include a mix of people who are both funded to participate in the hack week activities, and who are contributing their time voluntarily. In most cases, hack weeks would not happen without the generosity of many people who believe in the community building and educational mission of these events. In order to sustain the continued offering of hack weeks, it is important to find ways to acknowledge and if possible, reimburse people for their time and effort. Here are some ideas for recognizing people's contributions to hack weeks: ask how individuals would like to be recognized: some people want to be paid (e.g. more senior faculty who are not allowed to charge an existing grant for this type of work), others (e.g. postdocs) would rather have some form of formal recognition they can point to for their resume. provide payment: if the event is supported by grant funding, and if sufficient funds are available, then local organizers can often charge directly to a specific award for their time. For organizers recruited from outside an institution it may be possible offer an honorarium or gift as a way to recognize contributions. offer formal recognition: posting a photo, short biography and links to each organizer's website, GitHub page and other social media links can provide useful exposure to early career researchers. celebrate successes: make an effort to have a team activity such as a lunch or dinner after the event to celebrate everyone's contributions. This might be combined with an overall event debrief. have ways to express gratitude during the event: verbally recognizing organizer's contributions helps participants learn more about who contributed to the event. We have also experimented with things like a \"gratitude board\" where participants can anonomously post thank-you notes to anyone at the event. provide institutional affiliation: some institutions offer formal affiliation with their organization for people who contribute in substantial ways to an event. be efficient: thoughful administration practices implicitly recognize the importance of people's time and contributions. Small things, such as careful planning of meetings that have agendas and that regularly check-in with attendees regarding their time availability, can go a long way toward respecting the contributions of volunteers.","title":"Formation"},{"location":"OrganizingCommittee/Committee-formation/#committee-formation","text":"Usually a hack week is spearheaded by one or several individuals who have the motivation to host a hack week for a specific community.

In the case of an institution such as a university department starting a hack week, there may be enough local administrative support and tutorial leads without needing to find additional people. In other cases, for example our recent ICESat-2 hack week aimed at building software tools for a new NASA mission, we wanted to have participation from a broad community, especially members of the satellite's science team who had already begun to build software tools. In this case a broader range of recruitment efforts were necessary. For hack weeks that recur over multiple years, one might also recruit enthusiastic participants as organizers for subsequent events, as has been common for Astro Hack Week Because the organizing committee has a responsibility to model the principles and norms of behavior we aim to promote at a hack week, it is important to find people whose values align with this mission. Similarly, we want the organizing committee to be as diverse as possible to maximize the number of different perspectives in the room, and to offer role models to an equally diverse range of hack week participants. Here are some of general principles for recruiting a diverse and engaged organizing committee: Designate one person or a small committee to be responsible for recruitment. Among this group, build a list of potential recruitees who would be considered good organizers and who would benefit from being on the commitee in some way. Try to think not only of the most visible community leaders within your network, but also individuals from diverse communities who may offer different perspectives. This list may also contain names of people who have approached the hack week organizers with an intention to participate. For recruitees who are completely new to the group and who have not experienced a hack week, initiate a 30 minute meeting with the lead coordinator(s). Begin the meeting with a review of the hack week mission and ask the recruitee to offer some reflections on how their participation would serve to support that mission. This meeting is also an opportunity to share ideas on potential ways the recruitee can get involved. An e-mail invitation to both new and continuing potential committee members is an effective way to establish an organizational structure early in the process. The purpose of the message is to: thank the pontential committee member for considering this activity provide links to logistics information (event location, timing, travel arrangements) provide a reminder of the roles, responsibilities and potential time commitment for this activity offer to have this person's information included on the hack week website For some hack weeks we have used the participant application form as an efficient way to initially assemble an organizing committee. Committee members will be asked to fill out this form anyhow, for the sake of assessing our overall team diversity.

In most cases, hack weeks would not happen without the generosity of many people who believe in the community building and educational mission of these events. In order to sustain the continued offering of hack weeks, it is important to find ways to acknowledge and if possible, reimburse people for their time and effort. Here are some ideas for recognizing people's contributions to hack weeks: ask how individuals would like to be recognized: some people want to be paid (e.g. more senior faculty who are not allowed to charge an existing grant for this type of work), others (e.g. postdocs) would rather have some form of formal recognition they can point to for their resume. provide payment: if the event is supported by grant funding, and if sufficient funds are available, then local organizers can often charge directly to a specific award for their time. For organizers recruited from outside an institution it may be possible offer an honorarium or gift as a way to recognize contributions. offer formal recognition: posting a photo, short biography and links to each organizer's website, GitHub page and other social media links can provide useful exposure to early career researchers. celebrate successes: make an effort to have a team activity such as a lunch or dinner after the event to celebrate everyone's contributions. This might be combined with an overall event debrief. have ways to express gratitude during the event: verbally recognizing organizer's contributions helps participants learn more about who contributed to the event. We have also experimented with things like a \"gratitude board\" where participants can anonomously post thank-you notes to anyone at the event. provide institutional affiliation: some institutions offer formal affiliation with their organization for people who contribute in substantial ways to an event. be efficient: thoughful administration practices implicitly recognize the importance of people's time and contributions. Small things, such as careful planning of meetings that have agendas and that regularly check-in with attendees regarding their time availability, can go a long way toward respecting the contributions of volunteers.","title":"Recognizing contributions from committee memebers"},{"location":"OrganizingCommittee/Committee-intro/","text":"Organizing Committee A hack week's organizing committee includes anyone responsible for some level of decision making, planning and implementation of the hack week.

This brings up an important question: who do we invite to the hack week, and who do we leave out? The interactive nature of a hack week necessitates a careful procedure for participant selection. Selection committees will likely want to pick participants who are on board with and willing to advance the vision and values of the hack week model around collaboration and inclusivity. It may be tempting and straightforward to select candidates that are known personally to the committee as good citizens of the community, but we warn organizers that taking this approach might run counter several goals that a hack week might have: organizers should ask themselves how diverse their own networks are in practice. Do these networks contain predominantly researchers from privileged backgrounds and/or institutions? If so, they might want to consider strategies to broaden their reach and draw in researchers from outside of their networks. General Notes on the Selection Strategy Participant selection is one of the most involved and fraught, but also often overlooked aspects of organizing a participant-driven workshop. Organizers should start the process early , ideally at the same time as the team formulates their goals for organizing the hack week: formulating a strategy for selecting participants starts with a formulation of the goals and objectives of the workshop, along with the core values that organizers are aiming to implement and advance. From there, organizers may ask how participant selection might serve these goals and values. Possible goals are: * teaching data science methods to a wide range of researchers in your domain * encouraging collaborations between researchers of different fields * encouraging collaborations between researchers in different stages of their careers * improving access to modern methods and tools for researchers from underrepresented groups These are just examples: the goals of your workshop will necessarily depend on the particular community the hack week is embedded in and its needs. In the ideal case, the formulated goals lead to a clear strategy for selecting participants. For example, a workshop that targets early-career researchers and is more teaching-oriented may wish to preferentially admit graduate students and postdocs, whereas a workshop aimed at collaboration across career stages may prefer to mix career stages more broadly. In practice, however, it is often not trivial to match up workshop goals with specific choices to be made Similarly, organizers should articulate a strategy for assessing whether candidates have the appropriate skill level and are likely to participate in a way that creates a welcoming community for the group as a whole. This is generally a hard problem: research from the hiring literature suggests that there is an irreducible variance when trying to predict future performance from applications and intervies (see e.g. Highhouse, 2008 ). This is also the place where unconscious biases are most likely to creep into the process. Our best advice is to think critically about the selection process, ensure that all committee members are aware of common unconscious biases and are reminded of them throughout the selection process, and to evaluate and re-evaluate every part of the selection process before, during and after each workshop. For all of our hack weeks, we have been continuously learning and aiming to improve each year, and we continue to incorporate our own observations and external feedback in our workshops. Designing and Assessing Application Forms Because our hack weeks are oversubscribed, we generally ask participants to apply using a form, and then go through an internal selection procedure to select participants from among the applicants. What information candidates are asked to provide during the application differs quite widely among the hack weeks, but for all hack weeks (and indeed all workshops), it is important to keep in mind that one can only use information for a selection that has been collected on the application form . This may seem obvious, but experience has taught us in several instances that omissions on the form led to serious difficulties in our selection later. Especially with questions that aim to probe values and traits such as collaborativeness, designing questions that elicit useful information about the trait in question is difficult, and on many occasions a question we thought would do so did not, in fact, provide us with useful information. It is therefore worth the time and effort to design application forms carefully and intentionally. In the process, especially for open-ended questions, organizers should interrogate their own expectations about how participants might answer, and their biases in the answers that are expected. For example, a bias against non-native English speakers might lead reviewers to rate responses by these candidates lower. Similarly, for questions around diversity and inclusion, it is worth considering how differences across cultures and countries might affect what terminology and concepts candidates may be familiar with. There may also be effects related to seniority and familiarity with university environments and culture: more senior participants, especially those from more privileged institutions, might have a better sense of what information organizers are trying to elicit, simply because they have had more training in responding to questions like those likely asked on hack week application forms, and because they have been embedded in the particular culture of academic departments. While many of the hack weeks use Google Forms for application forms, it is worth critically examining that choice on the basis of respondent privacy and data rights, especially when forms may ask for sensitive demographic information. Assessing Qualifications Some hack weeks have requirements about the proficiency with programming or tools that participants are expected to have at the start of the hack week. Proficiency could be assessed, as in admission contexts, through university transcripts. However, grades do not necessarily reflect proficiency, and the grading systems employed in different countries may make an assessment difficult. Organizers could also simply ask participants whether they believe themselves to be at a certain skill levels, e.g. whether they are beginners, intermediate users or experts. Because there is no objective scale for what an \"expert programmer\" might be, and different people might give different answers to that question, assessing proficiency that way may lead to biases in the selection. In the hack weeks, we generally aim to assess proficiency with questions that tie skills to particular milestone achievements. For example, when asking about proficiency with machine learning, we might ask participants whether they've only encountered machine learning in their course work, whether they have used a machine learning algorithm for a research project, or whether they have developed and implemented machine learning algorithms themselves. One goal here is to make the questions as clear and unambiguous as possible. However, even here biases may affect the selection. In particular, participants from institutions or countries that are less well-resources may be less likely to have encountered computational classes or trainings in their home institutions. As a result, they may be less likely to be proficient programmers, and simply selecting on coding ability may select out these participants. We suggest that organizers view these questions in the larger context and take the opportunities that a particular applicant may or may not have had into account during the selection process. Assessing Core Values Hack weeks thrive through participants who are enthusiastic, curious, collaborative and kind to others. Assessing these traits is perhaps the most difficult part of any selection procedure. In addition, some hack weeks have asked questions around the contributions that participants are likely to make, and about the impact that someone's participation might have on their local community. Our hack weeks have assessed these values and traits through a range of different methods, including open-ended questions on the application form, personal statements and recommendation letters. As mentioned above, questions should be phrased thoughtfully and intentionally with the goal of minimizing biases during this stage. Following best practices from the hiring literature (e.g. Bohnet, 2015 ), these responses, letters or statements should be graded by several reviewers, using a clear, unambiguous set of rubrics that have been vetted carefully to minimize biases. Some hack weeks have performed this grading using a blinded set, where the names and demographics of the applicants were hidden from the raters. Other hack weeks have instead taken other information, for example career stage, home institution and demographic information into account at this stage in order to mediate effects that may systematically disadvantage some candidates. Based on our current knowledge as organizers, there is no single best way to do this: while there are well-documented effects that indicate that certain candidates may be disadvantaged based on their name alone in hiring contexts (STUDY), some research also shows that committees that are careful about taking systematic effects and biases into account tend to do worse when demographic information about the candidates is removed (ALSO STUDY). Once all applications have been rated, the members of the organizing committee might then take the ratings and carefully examine them for biases. For example, one may look at interrate reliability to see whether specific raters tend to only give grades in a certain subset of the available ratings. One may also look at whether certain groups (for example junior academics) are systematically rated worse, indicating that biases have not been fully eliminated during earlier stages of the process. Data visualizations are enormously helpful here, as is a practice of multiple organizers taking an independent look at the ratings generated by the reviewers. Questions about the Participant's Background For all hack weeks, considerable thought and discussion goes into which information to elicit regarding the applicants' backgrounds. This includes for example their current institution, academic field of study and/or research, and career stage, but also questions around gender identity, sexual orientation and race and ethnicity. In particular sensitive questions around one's identity are difficult to phrase and incorporate in selection procedures. Organizers may decide to simply not include them. However, if the pool of applicants is biased with respect to those categories, organizers risk that the workshop itself may reproduce those biases, or exacerbate them if other categories of assessment (for example open-ended answers) correlate with demographic categories. There are different ways many of these questions can be phrased, and different ways that information can be included in a participant selection strategy. Questions related to demographic background should always be voluntary, and non-disclosure should not negatively affect someone's likelihood of being accepted. Workshops that are globally advertised may run into difficulties with phrasing questions around race and ethnicity, where categories may be defined differently in different countries. Hack weeks have generally done one of two things: either follow US-based categorization of race and ethnicity, or formulate a question that asked whether someone considered themselves a minority with respect to race and ethnicity in their field of study. The former will allow for a more fine-grained selection process that takes into account how different groups experience different kinds of oppression and privilege, but they may also require applicants, especially those that do not identify with the US-based categorization, into a system that does not correspond to their lived reality. The latter approach side-steps those cross-cultural issues, but combines all participant into minority and non-minority categories, which may disproportionally disadvantage some groups. In addition, recent feedback suggests that phrasing the question this way might induce stereotype threat in our applicants, and thus some hack weeks are moving away from that approach. One potential solution might be to move away from an approach of categorization for demographic categories (including for example also gender identity) and simply allow applicants to self-identify using a free-form response. How should these categories---professional categories like someone's career stage or institution, and demographic ones like gender identity and race and ethnicity---be included in the selection process? As mentioned above, they could be part of a selection where individual candidates are considered on the bases of their responses as well as the information disclosed in this section of the application form (if it was disclosed). Career stage, location and demographic categories could in this scenario inform selection by providing information about the applicant's opportunities, and the privilege or oppression they may have experienced in the field. Some of the hack weeks, motivated by the idea of diversifying the workshop across many of these categories, have used a selection process mediated by an algorithm (implemented in the software Entrofy ) to support the selection. In this approach, the committee will generally perform some pre-selection based on the open-ended answers, personal statements and recommendation letters to identify a subset of qualified candidates. The final cohort is selected using the algorithm, where the objective is to have the cohort globally match a set of target values across all categories. Astro Hack Week and Geo Hack Week have both implemented procedures that followed this model. It is worth nothing here that the use of an algorithm does not make the selection intrinsically less biased . Categories, the allowed values within each category, and the target values are all chosen by humans, most likely the organizers, and are thus subject to the biases these humans impose during creation of the application form or the subsequent selection on open-ended answers. As Meredith Broussard states in her book \"Artificial Unintelligence\" , algorithms are social constructs, because they are constructed by humans. Using algorithmic mediation in selection processes does not absolve organizers of critical interrogation of their procedures and the biases they might impose on it, however unintentionally. One advantage of the approach employing Entrofy is that it allows for more straightforward transparency and accountability than more traditional approaches might. Organizers can (and do so in practice) share the details of the selection procedure, categories and targets used, and often the code employed for selection (after removal of all confidential participant data). However, the structure of the algorithm requires that applicants can fit themselves into pre-defined categories, which may be difficult given the aforementioned problems when categories are intrinsically ill-defined or not inclusive. The hack weeks are continuously iterating and changing our approach with the aim to make our selection procedures more equitable and fair, and we share information and experiences among one another to learn from our different events. However, none of us feel that we have a single set of best practices to share that would guarantee and equitable selection. Our best advice is: Be critical of your selection procedures, and continuously evaluate, solicit feedback and continue learning around the issues that make selection difficult and fraught with biases Educate yourself on the biases that typically appear in selection procedures: the branch of industrial and organization psychology has both in-depth scientific works as well as popular science-level introductions to offer that may be helpful, and more and more organizations share their hiring procedures and their thinking around how to approach difficult issues within hiring. Be as transparent and accountable as possible. Admitting participants for an oversubscribed workshop necessarily means that others will be turned away. In a space like academia where rejection is relatively common, receiving that notice from a workshop might lead to self-doubt. It is always useful to share the thinking behind the selection, the procedures and the general outcomes. In addition, as organizing committees we are aware that our knowledge around issues of equity and inclusion is incomplete and fraught with our own biases that we bring into this space. Transparency enables critical feedback from the community, which in turn enables improvement Protect your participants' data. During the application process, participants may share sensitive data with the organizers, who are therefore obliged to keep that information confidential and protected from exploitation through internal or outside actors.","title":"Participant Selection"},{"location":"ParticipantSelection/ParticipantSelection-intro/#selecting-participants-for-hack-weeks","text":"All of our hack weeks have been oversubscribed by at least a factor of 2.

In the hack weeks, we generally aim to assess proficiency with questions that tie skills to particular milestone achievements. For example, when asking about proficiency with machine learning, we might ask participants whether they've only encountered machine learning in their course work, whether they have used a machine learning algorithm for a research project, or whether they have developed and implemented machine learning algorithms themselves. One goal here is to make the questions as clear and unambiguous as possible. However, even here biases may affect the selection. In particular, participants from institutions or countries that are less well-resources may be less likely to have encountered computational classes or trainings in their home institutions. As a result, they may be less likely to be proficient programmers, and simply selecting on coding ability may select out these participants. We suggest that organizers view these questions in the larger context and take the opportunities that a particular applicant may or may not have had into account during the selection process.","title":"Assessing Qualifications"},{"location":"ParticipantSelection/ParticipantSelection-intro/#assessing-core-values","text":"Hack weeks thrive through participants who are enthusiastic, curious, collaborative and kind to others. Assessing these traits is perhaps the most difficult part of any selection procedure. In addition, some hack weeks have asked questions around the contributions that participants are likely to make, and about the impact that someone's participation might have on their local community. Our hack weeks have assessed these values and traits through a range of different methods, including open-ended questions on the application form, personal statements and recommendation letters. As mentioned above, questions should be phrased thoughtfully and intentionally with the goal of minimizing biases during this stage. Following best practices from the hiring literature (e.g. Bohnet, 2015 ), these responses, letters or statements should be graded by several reviewers, using a clear, unambiguous set of rubrics that have been vetted carefully to minimize biases. Some hack weeks have performed this grading using a blinded set, where the names and demographics of the applicants were hidden from the raters. Other hack weeks have instead taken other information, for example career stage, home institution and demographic information into account at this stage in order to mediate effects that may systematically disadvantage some candidates. Based on our current knowledge as organizers, there is no single best way to do this: while there are well-documented effects that indicate that certain candidates may be disadvantaged based on their name alone in hiring contexts (STUDY), some research also shows that committees that are careful about taking systematic effects and biases into account tend to do worse when demographic information about the candidates is removed (ALSO STUDY). Once all applications have been rated, the members of the organizing committee might then take the ratings and carefully examine them for biases. For example, one may look at interrate reliability to see whether specific raters tend to only give grades in a certain subset of the available ratings. One may also look at whether certain groups (for example junior academics) are systematically rated worse, indicating that biases have not been fully eliminated during earlier stages of the process. Data visualizations are enormously helpful here, as is a practice of multiple organizers taking an independent look at the ratings generated by the reviewers.","title":"Assessing Core Values"},{"location":"ParticipantSelection/ParticipantSelection-intro/#questions-about-the-participants-background","text":"For all hack weeks, considerable thought and discussion goes into which information to elicit regarding the applicants' backgrounds. This includes for example their current institution, academic field of study and/or research, and career stage, but also questions around gender identity, sexual orientation and race and ethnicity. In particular sensitive questions around one's identity are difficult to phrase and incorporate in selection procedures. Organizers may decide to simply not include them. However, if the pool of applicants is biased with respect to those categories, organizers risk that the workshop itself may reproduce those biases, or exacerbate them if other categories of assessment (for example open-ended answers) correlate with demographic categories. There are different ways many of these questions can be phrased, and different ways that information can be included in a participant selection strategy. Questions related to demographic background should always be voluntary, and non-disclosure should not negatively affect someone's likelihood of being accepted. Workshops that are globally advertised may run into difficulties with phrasing questions around race and ethnicity, where categories may be defined differently in different countries. Hack weeks have generally done one of two things: either follow US-based categorization of race and ethnicity, or formulate a question that asked whether someone considered themselves a minority with respect to race and ethnicity in their field of study. The former will allow for a more fine-grained selection process that takes into account how different groups experience different kinds of oppression and privilege, but they may also require applicants, especially those that do not identify with the US-based categorization, into a system that does not correspond to their lived reality. The latter approach side-steps those cross-cultural issues, but combines all participant into minority and non-minority categories, which may disproportionally disadvantage some groups. In addition, recent feedback suggests that phrasing the question this way might induce stereotype threat in our applicants, and thus some hack weeks are moving away from that approach. One potential solution might be to move away from an approach of categorization for demographic categories (including for example also gender identity) and simply allow applicants to self-identify using a free-form response. How should these categories---professional categories like someone's career stage or institution, and demographic ones like gender identity and race and ethnicity---be included in the selection process? As mentioned above, they could be part of a selection where individual candidates are considered on the bases of their responses as well as the information disclosed in this section of the application form (if it was disclosed). Career stage, location and demographic categories could in this scenario inform selection by providing information about the applicant's opportunities, and the privilege or oppression they may have experienced in the field. Some of the hack weeks, motivated by the idea of diversifying the workshop across many of these categories, have used a selection process mediated by an algorithm (implemented in the software Entrofy ) to support the selection. In this approach, the committee will generally perform some pre-selection based on the open-ended answers, personal statements and recommendation letters to identify a subset of qualified candidates. The final cohort is selected using the algorithm, where the objective is to have the cohort globally match a set of target values across all categories. Astro Hack Week and Geo Hack Week have both implemented procedures that followed this model. It is worth nothing here that the use of an algorithm does not make the selection intrinsically less biased . Categories, the allowed values within each category, and the target values are all chosen by humans, most likely the organizers, and are thus subject to the biases these humans impose during creation of the application form or the subsequent selection on open-ended answers. As Meredith Broussard states in her book \"Artificial Unintelligence\" , algorithms are social constructs, because they are constructed by humans. Using algorithmic mediation in selection processes does not absolve organizers of critical interrogation of their procedures and the biases they might impose on it, however unintentionally. One advantage of the approach employing Entrofy is that it allows for more straightforward transparency and accountability than more traditional approaches might. Organizers can (and do so in practice) share the details of the selection procedure, categories and targets used, and often the code employed for selection (after removal of all confidential participant data). However, the structure of the algorithm requires that applicants can fit themselves into pre-defined categories, which may be difficult given the aforementioned problems when categories are intrinsically ill-defined or not inclusive. The hack weeks are continuously iterating and changing our approach with the aim to make our selection procedures more equitable and fair, and we share information and experiences among one another to learn from our different events. However, none of us feel that we have a single set of best practices to share that would guarantee and equitable selection. Our best advice is: Be critical of your selection procedures, and continuously evaluate, solicit feedback and continue learning around the issues that make selection difficult and fraught with biases Educate yourself on the biases that typically appear in selection procedures: the branch of industrial and organization psychology has both in-depth scientific works as well as popular science-level introductions to offer that may be helpful, and more and more organizations share their hiring procedures and their thinking around how to approach difficult issues within hiring. Be as transparent and accountable as possible. Admitting participants for an oversubscribed workshop necessarily means that others will be turned away. In a space like academia where rejection is relatively common, receiving that notice from a workshop might lead to self-doubt. It is always useful to share the thinking behind the selection, the procedures and the general outcomes. In addition, as organizing committees we are aware that our knowledge around issues of equity and inclusion is incomplete and fraught with our own biases that we bring into this space. Transparency enables critical feedback from the community, which in turn enables improvement Protect your participants' data. During the application process, participants may share sensitive data with the organizers, who are therefore obliged to keep that information confidential and protected from exploitation through internal or outside actors.","title":"Questions about the Participant's Background"},{"location":"Timeline/Timeline-Intro/","text":"Timeline and Checklist for Hack Weeks This is a very briefly worded checklist for organizers of hack weeks, based on the supplementary materials of the hack weeks paper These are suggestions that we\u2019ve found helpful in the past. Feel free to adapt and change according to your needs! About 1-1.5 years in advance Form a Scientific and Local Organizing Committee(s) Define the different roles required for successful organization: e.g. building a website, coordinating tutorial leads, corresponding with participants, advertising the event, coordinating with local staff (about rooms, catering etc), facilitation during the event Build a team that is distributed in expertise and interests across these roles Elect a \"cat herder in chief\": a person who makes sure the team is on track, online calls get scheduled and reminders are sent out. Make sure things get done: a. Define all roles b. Build a roadmap for completion of tasks c. Assign tasks to team members Establish rules for working together (e.g. a code of conduct among the committee) Settle on team communication (asynchronous communication via slack/e-mail? Regular online calls?) Objectives Figure out your motivation for organizing a hack week. What drives the need for a hack week? a. What are the objectives of a hack week? Set the objectives and goals: b. What do you want participants to produce? c. What do you want participants to have learned? d. How/where/in what form do you want participants to connect with each other? e. What other possible goals could you have during a hack week Prepare for Feedback + Evaluation a. Are there certain goals (or possibly requirements from a funding agency) with respect to evaluation of the workshop? Clarify those goals early on! b. If any scientific research is planned in any way in relation to the hack week, this is the time to initiate the procedures for ethical research (depending on country/institution; in the US this is run by an Institutional Review Board)! In most countries, any human subject research must be cleared by the ethics board of the institution! Do this! Location + Venue Determine country/city for your hack week a. Are there visa requirements for the country? b. How easy/difficult is it to travel to/from this location? c. Is the country the location is in restrictive in any way or unsafe for certain participants (e.g. participants of colour, LGBT participants, participants from certain countries, \u2026) d. What is accommodation like in this country/city? e. How good is the public transport in the chosen location? f. How expensive are travel + accommodation + food in the proposed location? Is this financially accessible to students and participants from institutions with less funding? g. What is the environment like with respect to your field? Is there a significant local presence (might not be important, but could be!) h. Is there something for participants to do outside of the hack week (may be a plus or minus, depending on whether you want participants to work together all the time) i. What is available in terms of families, child support, \u2026 ? j. Is the location known to have tech industry? This may only matter if you\u2019re interested in connecting with local companies and/or ask them for funding. Venue: Considerations for facilitating hacking a. What are the venue\u2019s costs? Is there local funding available that might come with the venue? b. How large is the room? Probably want a room that\u2019s at least \u2153 larger than technically needed for the number of people (so a hack week with 50 people should be in a room advertised for 65 or so) c. Are there separate rooms, or one big one? Separate rooms might facilitate break-outs, but make it harder to keep the group together and allow for work across projects d. What is the set-up for the room? Lecture theatre-style or tables? Theatre-stype is terrible for collaboration, so try not to spend (too much) time in a lecture theatre e. Are components of the room moveable and can chairs/tables be reconfigured? Reconfiguring helps with flexible group formation and interactive work. f. How many white boards/chalk boards are there? Depending on group size, probably want more than 3 g. How many projectors are there? You need at least 1 that\u2019s visible from the entire room. h. Power outlets! Need lots of them i. Internet: high-speed internet is crucial for many data-related tasks Venue: General Considerations a. Does the venue require an application (e.g. the Lorentz Centre)? If so, check application procedures + deadlines >1 year in advance! b. Is the space accessible? Can people with physical disabilities move freely (e.g. participants with wheelchairs, blind participants, \u2026)? Are there elevators or only stairs? c. Are bathrooms gender-neutral or can they be made gender-neutral? Is there administrative support in terms of practical organization (e.g. handling reimbursement claims, ordering lunch/coffee/rooms, assisting with accommodation, ...)? This can be a huge help to the SOC! d. How far away is the venue from available accommodation? e. Is there coffee/tea? f. Advertise location/venue as soon as possible once you know the dates and location (e.g. via the AAS Astrostatistics Working Group, this list of astronomy meetings, the Astrostatistics + Astroinformatics Portal, e-mail lists, local universities, everyone you know, \u2026) Funding A hack week requires funding for a number of different costs: rooms (not always), lunch, coffee, travel funding for some of the participants, potentially salaries for organizers and especially administrative staff, and of course some incidentals. Do rooms need to be paid for extra? This is often the case e.g. in the US! Check this! What are available governmental funding sources? (multi-)national agencies (NIH, NASA, ERC, \u2026): this funding probably needs an application >1 year in advance of the event Are there private foundations that might be willing to provide funding (e.g. Moore and Sloan Foundations)? Make contact + check procedures >1 year in advance Are there other local funding sources available (e.g. does the university/venue have funding or come with funding attached to the workshop)? Are there private companies you can ask for funding? Check the local tech scene! In the past, local offices of Google, IBM, Galvanize, and GitHub have all provided funding to AstroHackWeek How much funding do you intend to reserve for travel grants to participants? How does your funding from different sources match up with different funding needs (sometimes, funding sources come with conditions for what can/cannot be funded)? How much are you likely to charge for registration? Charging a small amount for registration helps participants buy into coming (people are more likely to attend if they\u2019ve put down money for it), but charging a large amount will make the meeting inaccessible Check how to collect registration fees! In most countries, this may require an entity that can deal with the tax implications of having people give you money! If at all possible, try to convince the hosting venue or your university to deal with this! About 1 year to 6 months in advance Website Prepare a Website : this should be done early on, definitely as soon as the hack week is announced. a. What? Why? Where? How? b. Who are the organizers? c. Who is speaking (if you know it already)? d. What is the schedule (if you know it already)? e. Local information: travel + transport, hotel(s), food options f. Contact information for the SOC g. Information about live stream, code of conduct, \u2026 h. (Link to application form, once it\u2019s live) Set up an e-mail address as point of contact for potential participants Set up a mailing list for announcements that interested researchers can sign up for. Announce the event Where are typical venues for announcing events in your community? Prepare e-mail to colleagues + mailing list Reach out to communities traditionally underserved in your field (e.g. community colleges, minority working groups within your professional societies) Participant Selection Important note : This is one of the most important parts of preparing the workshop, so it deserves ample time and consideration. Be aware that there are systematic biases likely present in every part of this! E.g. participants from certain backgrounds might have had fewer opportunities to learn certain skills (like coding), so requiring a certain amount of coding skills might disadvantage certain groups inadvertently! If you require things like motivational statements and/or letters of reference, be aware of biases in recommendation letters, and things like biases related to English language ability. Fundamentally, be aware that there might be biases in the process, and work to mitigate those biases wherever you can! Any information you need for your selection process must be assessed during the application stage. This might seem obvious, but there\u2019s always a question we forget to include. Have a detailed conversation about what the ideal mix of participants is: a. Are there prerequisites for attending the workshop (e.g. a minimum level of coding ability)? b. Are there particular groups that are targeted by the workshop? What are possible axes of selection (e.g. motivation to attend, career stage, geographic origin, skills in a certain subject, demographic variables like gender identity, race, ethnicity, \u2026)? a. Should there be a selection for merit? Think about ways to assess the categories of selection carefully. Any category for selection needs to be translated into some question or application material that can be provided by participants (e.g. CV? Statement of purpose? Letters of recommendation?) a. What are local rules and laws (university/country) around asking about demographic variables? (note that asking participants to disclose personal demographic information should always be voluntary!) b. Asking participants to self-assess skill levels is difficult and fraught with biases. If you ask people whether they\u2019re an \u201cexpert\u201d, \u201cintermediate\u201d or \u201cbeginner\u201d at a certain skill, it\u2019s hard to figure out what \u201cexpert\u201d means for any given person. Try to tie categories to explicit milestones (e.g. \u201cI have edited a python script written by others\u201d, \u201cI have written my own Python script\u201d, \u201cI maintain several open-source packages\u201d, \u2026) Set up an application form: need to figure out what the best way to collect data is (e.g. a google form, \u2026); be aware if there are local/institutional rules about data collection Open form + advertise workshop + application (~10 months ahead of time, leave open for at least 8 weeks!) a. During this time, make sure that the registration procedure/form is set up and that funding is in place: funding must be in place by the time participants are being accepted! b. Make sure there is a back-up (ideally several back-ups) for your collected participant data. If you lose it, it\u2019s gone and you\u2019re in trouble! Build infrastructure for selecting participants and decide on decision procedures: a. Ask committee members to rate applicants? Need to set up categories and scoring rubrics for grading + decision metrics for selection! b. Use an algorithm? Here\u2019s one you could use: https://github.com/dhuppenkothen/entrofy c. Combine both? Run participant selection (ideally ~6 months before the workshop, to give participants ample time to make travel plans and apply for visas) Notify participants of selection, give them a timeline for responding (especially if the workshop is oversubscribed, you might want to give them ~2 weeks so that you can rapidly admit alternative participants for those that drop out) Iterate as participants decline/accept + run registration for those that accept Assign funding, make sure the reimbursement procedure is clear (are people reimbursed and how? Or is the venue booking for the participants?), and inform participants how their travel/childcare expenses will be reimbursed 6 months before the workshop Code of Conduct : As organizing committee, decide what acceptable/inacceptable behaviour looks like for your workshop, and how you can work towards being welcoming to all participants (including shy participants, participants from underrepresented groups, \u2026), and settle on a Code of Conduct a. Note : it is also possible to use part of the time for participants to co-create a code of conduct for the group, but this needs to be carefully facilitated. Find and prep tutorial speakers (if you run tutorials). We know by experience that it is not straightforward even for good teachers to prepare a tutorial for a hack week. Be sure to give tutorials speakers guidance on what you would like them to talk about, and what the appropriate level is (lower than they might expect!) Build a facilitation plan . Group activities (how participants get to know each other, how they pitch hacks, figure out groups and then work in those groups, how they work together during tutorials) work better when actively facilitated, i.e. when there are helpful structures imposed or suggested by the organizers. This is especially important to allow shy participants or more junior researchers participate fully. Work out this plan in advance. This is also your chance to experiment with new ways for people to interact/work with each other! 3-0 months before the workshop Set up a live stream (if one is to be run). Depending on the venue, this can be either trivially easy or nearly impossible. If you are heavily oversubscribed and intend to include outside researchers via a live stream, be sure to figure out the details early. Settle on modes of communication . How do you want participants to communicate with each other? Is slack appropriate? Set up the infrastructure for the tutorials, break-outs, hacking, and other activities you want to run a. Tutorials: you could host them on GitHub and ask tutorial teachers to upload tutorials there (do this in advance so they don\u2019t host it somewhere else!) b. Hack week products: make a public folder where participants can dump things produced at the hack week (though also encourage them to upload to e.g. GitHub) c. Hack idea doc: it\u2019s useful to have a central doc where participants can add ideas for a hack and ideally discuss them in comments d. Wrap-up slides: make a shared slideshow where participants can add their wrapup-slides e. Set up ways for participants to communicate and coordinate online (and for outside researchers to connect): e.g. Slack f. Twitter hashtag? Potentially set up a shared software environment for participants. If the hack week tutorials involve a lot of coding in one language, it can be helpful to set up a shared environment (e.g. vial JupyterHub or Docker) for all participants to use, in order to minimize installation issues. Send welcome e-mail to participants with important information about the workshop, the Code of Conduct, travel arrangements etc. It is also useful to encourage them at this point to start adding ideas for hacks and break-outs in the respective documents. Set up a basic evaluation survey. Set up questions on parts of the hack week you want to receive feedback on. Ideally do this before the hack week, otherwise this might cause some stress during the week itself! During the Hack Week Important note: do not try to hack and facilitate at the same time . 1-2 organizers should be designated facilitators, and their main job should be to keep the hack week running. Trying to both hack and facilitate is very, very difficult and likely not go well. 1. Facilitate, facilitate, facilitate . One of the main jobs during the hack week is to make sure everyone is working in the mode that works best for them. Make sure that participants feel comfortable approaching others about contributing to their hacks, that the groups are working well, that there are no interpersonal problems. 2. Keep in touch with tutorial speakers: make sure they\u2019re prepared and have all they need 3. Ask participants to acknowledge the hack week in publications, software, etc. This can be done for example in the acknowledgment section of a paper, or with a hashtag on GitHub. 4. Set up a break-out board and keep track of which break-outs have a lot of votes a. You also need to find people to teach; be mindful of participants\u2019 time and don\u2019t overburden few of your more experienced participants with too many break-outs 5. Encourage experienced participants to help with the tutorial of the day, to keep them engaged with material they already know 6. Run regular check-in session (pitches, wrap-ups) 7. Be aware of impostor phenomenon being present at your event, and take steps to mitigate it a. Careful facilitation can help b. High representation of otherwise underrepresented groups may make minority participants less like an outsider and help mitigate impostor phenomenon c. Stating its existence and prevalence in the beginning can help participants feel less alone with these emotions 8. Run the survey at the end of the week. It is super helpful to run the survey on the last day, because participation drops very sharply once participants have left. Set aside a little bit of time for participants to fill out the survey. 9. Keep notes on experiences and observations during the week. What seems to work well? What didn\u2019t? What was missing? What could you try next time? After the Hack Week Evaluation Evaluate the results of the survey. Take the survey results and find out what participants actually said about the hack week. Distill some first ideas and conclusions for next time. Debrief . Set a meeting with the organizing committee to debrief after the hack week (ideally in the following two weeks, such that organizers had some time to think about it, but also not so far that they forget). Go through their debrief notes and the survey results, and note down changes to be made or experiments to be run the next year. Keep track of output (papers, software, websites, news articles, blog posts, \u2026). This is useful information to keep track of one axis of usefulness of the hack week, and also useful for future funding applications and reports Report Write a wrap-up report . Check whether any of your funding sources require a report, and write one if they do using the information gathered during this evaluation stage Committee Start choosing the committee for the next year.","title":"Timeline"},{"location":"Timeline/Timeline-Intro/#timeline-and-checklist-for-hack-weeks","text":"This is a very briefly worded checklist for organizers of hack weeks, based on the supplementary materials of the hack weeks paper These are suggestions that we\u2019ve found helpful in the past.

Be aware that there are systematic biases likely present in every part of this! E.g. participants from certain backgrounds might have had fewer opportunities to learn certain skills (like coding), so requiring a certain amount of coding skills might disadvantage certain groups inadvertently! If you require things like motivational statements and/or letters of reference, be aware of biases in recommendation letters, and things like biases related to English language ability. Fundamentally, be aware that there might be biases in the process, and work to mitigate those biases wherever you can! Any information you need for your selection process must be assessed during the application stage. This might seem obvious, but there\u2019s always a question we forget to include. Have a detailed conversation about what the ideal mix of participants is: a. Are there prerequisites for attending the workshop (e.g. a minimum level of coding ability)? b. Are there particular groups that are targeted by the workshop? What are possible axes of selection (e.g. motivation to attend, career stage, geographic origin, skills in a certain subject, demographic variables like gender identity, race, ethnicity, \u2026)? a. Should there be a selection for merit? Think about ways to assess the categories of selection carefully. Any category for selection needs to be translated into some question or application material that can be provided by participants (e.g. CV? Statement of purpose? Letters of recommendation?) a. What are local rules and laws (university/country) around asking about demographic variables? (note that asking participants to disclose personal demographic information should always be voluntary!) b. Asking participants to self-assess skill levels is difficult and fraught with biases. If you ask people whether they\u2019re an \u201cexpert\u201d, \u201cintermediate\u201d or \u201cbeginner\u201d at a certain skill, it\u2019s hard to figure out what \u201cexpert\u201d means for any given person. Try to tie categories to explicit milestones (e.g. \u201cI have edited a python script written by others\u201d, \u201cI have written my own Python script\u201d, \u201cI maintain several open-source packages\u201d, \u2026) Set up an application form: need to figure out what the best way to collect data is (e.g. a google form, \u2026); be aware if there are local/institutional rules about data collection Open form + advertise workshop + application (~10 months ahead of time, leave open for at least 8 weeks!) a. During this time, make sure that the registration procedure/form is set up and that funding is in place: funding must be in place by the time participants are being accepted! b. Make sure there is a back-up (ideally several back-ups) for your collected participant data. If you lose it, it\u2019s gone and you\u2019re in trouble! Build infrastructure for selecting participants and decide on decision procedures: a. Ask committee members to rate applicants? Need to set up categories and scoring rubrics for grading + decision metrics for selection! b. Use an algorithm? Here\u2019s one you could use: https://github.com/dhuppenkothen/entrofy c. Combine both? Run participant selection (ideally ~6 months before the workshop, to give participants ample time to make travel plans and apply for visas) Notify participants of selection, give them a timeline for responding (especially if the workshop is oversubscribed, you might want to give them ~2 weeks so that you can rapidly admit alternative participants for those that drop out) Iterate as participants decline/accept + run registration for those that accept Assign funding, make sure the reimbursement procedure is clear (are people reimbursed and how?

Find and prep tutorial speakers (if you run tutorials). We know by experience that it is not straightforward even for good teachers to prepare a tutorial for a hack week. Be sure to give tutorials speakers guidance on what you would like them to talk about, and what the appropriate level is (lower than they might expect!) Build a facilitation plan . Group activities (how participants get to know each other, how they pitch hacks, figure out groups and then work in those groups, how they work together during tutorials) work better when actively facilitated, i.e. when there are helpful structures imposed or suggested by the organizers.

With this in mind, we suggest the following guidelines when developing a tutorial: Tutorials should be designed to address broad challenges in the data science community being served by the event. Speaking with community groups, reading blogs and attending workshops are good ways to connect with the most urgent data science challenges in a particular community. For example, the ICESat-2 hack week tutorial content was largely informed by members of the satellite's science team who were directly involved in releasing the data to the research community. We also ask participants during the application process what they would like to learn about as a way to inform tutorial development for that particular event. Based on the needs of the community, and in consultation with other committee members, build an outline of desired learning outcomes. Consider how you would like to balance teaching of core concepts versus the technical aspects of operating a specific tool or library. Be mindful of spending too much time on a tool you might have just discovered that represents the latest and greatest, but might not be something the community decides to adopt in the long term. Include content that provides an initial picture of what might be possible when applying a particular data science tool. Save detailed explanations on a narrow topic for a later breakout session. Start with simple explanations that attend to people who are seeing this content for the first time, and keep advanced participants engaged by inviting them to assist others, explore more advanced concepts through individual study, and engage in constructive questioning with the tutorial lead to further clarify concepts for beginners. Make your tutorials interactive through live coding challenges, working through a Juypter Notebook together, or interactive discussions. Leave some space when you are not talking for people to work through examples and ask questions. give a lot of thought to the pacing of the tutorial, considering how much time participants will need for various tasks. Tutorials that are too fast will cause undue stress and people will be unable to finish everything in time. take a bit of time to review tutorials offered at our previous hackweeks. Here is an example of a particularly well-crafted tutorial by Catherine Kuhn at the 2018 Geo Hack Week. Tutorial Timeline It is a good idea to prepare your tutorials well in advance of the event so that they can be reviewed by other tutorial developers and members of the community. In some cases early preparation is required so that shared computing resources can be tested and configured to contain the libraries and datasets necessary to run the tutorials. Early tutorial preparation also cretes an opportunity for exploring the overall flow of tutorial ideas and concepts across the event. Technical Considerations Teaching software and data science tools to a large group of people is challenging when each person arrives with a different computer and operating system configuration. To avoid these challenges we often deploy shared computing resources, such as an instance of JupyterHub on a commercial cloud platform. We then have participants log in to this system using GitHub credentials. This centralized computing architecture can be directly linked to virtual drives that store any of the sample datasets used in the tutorials. Each tutorial can also be tested in advance on this system to ensure all the correct libraries and tools are installed. There are several computing ecosystems that can be explored to support the technical resources described above. We have the most experiece deploying Pangeo instances that involve deploying JupyterHub with Kubernetes . This blog about ICESat-2 hack week explains our typical Pangeo deployment in more detail. Tutorial Formats We have experimented with several different ways to construct and serve tutorial content online. These include: using Software Carpentry templates organization (an example implementation is our Geo Hack Week vector tutorial ). This apprach enables the building of a curriculum over time that is openly available as a reference to the community. Another advantage to this format is that others can request to add content or make corrections via GitHub pull requests. A disadvantage to this approach is that participants cannot interact directly with coding examples, as is possible with a Jupyter Notebook. It also takes more time for tutorial leads to copy and paste code into the markdown format of these tutorial templates. preparing Jupyter Notebooks that combine explanatory text and graphics together with code. These notebooks can be copied directly to each participant's working directly and they can instantly begin following along with the instructor during the tutorial. Some tutorial leads include all of their code in the notebook and have participants run the code in tandem with the teacher. Others keep the code blocks empty and ask participants to write the code in real time, or give them time to compose their own code blocks in response to instructional prompts. presenting a slideshow containing text and images to teach specific concepts. This is a more traditional style of lecturing that might be appropriate for providing big picture overviews about the scientific underpinnings of specific data science applications. teaching with hand-written drawings, text or equations at a whiteboard. Sometimes it helps just to step away from the screen and explain some core concepts with a traditional (pre-PowerPoint era) lecture. Interactive content The hack week model strives to provide participants with an interactive and immersive experience. Building interactive tutorials is a good way to achieve this goal. We have experimented with the Software Carpentry approach to teaching software which involves inviting participants to solve a coding challenge or work through an example during the tutorial. We provide each particiant with two different colored post-it notes that they can use to indicate if they do or do not need help with a particular example. This approach requires having multiple assistants in the room who are familiar with the tutorial and can be available to help answer questions. Without these assistants it can become too overwhelming for one tutorial lead to both navigate the overall pace of the teaching and answer detailed questions from individual participants. Tutorial Scheduling and flow Once the overall learning outcomes of each individual tutorial are articulated, the planning committee should spend some time considering the best way to sequence the tutorials. Ideally core concepts, for example the use of GitHub and other collaborative software tools, should be introduced early in the event. If possible, look for ways that one tutorial can build on the previous one. In some cases it may be desirable to have a common sample dataset that is worked with across multiple tutorials as a way to provide a coherent theme. The scheduling of tutorials will also impact the overall pacing of the event. Consider the energy of the participants at different stages, and their capacity to absorb new knowedge. For example, having too many dense and more complex tutorials on a given day might not leave people with enough energy to take part in projects or hacking later in the day.","title":"Design"},{"location":"Tutorials/Tutorial-design/#tutorial-design","text":"A purpose of a hack week is to expose participants to a broad range of data science tools and methods.

There are two key components to discussing the venue: the location (i.e. the country, city and location within the city) that the physical venue is located in, and the venue itself, i.e. the room or rooms where most of the interactions will take place. Below, we will discuss each in turn. Here, like with all parts of hack week organization, accessibility and inclusion are the key considerations that should come first. Location In organizing a hack week events are faced with opportunities and constraints related to the overall physical location of the venue. For example, it may be easier for an organizer to reserve rooms at their local university, or funding agencies might have restrictions on where the event can take place. There are, however, larger considerations that should play a role when deciding on a venue. For example, it may be difficult to impossible for participants from certain countries to obtain travel visas for the US and some European countries. Organizing a workshop in these countries may therefore exclude an entire group of potential participants. Similarly, flights to certain locations may be particularly expensive and/or cumbersome, requiring multi-day travel for the majority of participants. This, in turn, may exclude participants e.g. with childcare responsibilities, who do not want to spend an extra 3-4 days travelling, or participants for whom long travel is otherwise challenging. There is some trade-off: large cities often have more direct flights (and often also cheaper flights) available, but accommodation may be particularly expensive. This may present a challenge for participants from institutions or countries where funding for conference travel is scarce. Fundraising a significant amount of travel funding through sponsorships and grants can alleviate some of the financial concerns, and in some places, university accommodation might be available for much less cost than a hotel room would cost. Organizing the workshop early, with participant selection being completed somewhere around five months before the start of the workshop can also alleviate both costs and visa issues. Organizers should be prepared to provide some support (e.g. invitation letters) to participants requiring visas. In addition to accommodation and travel, it is worth asking how accessible the city where the hack week is located is to different foreigners. For example, a small town in France or Germany may be difficult to navigate for participants who do not speak those languages. Many old European cities have uneven cobblestone streets and buildings (especially restaurants or bars) made inaccessible by stairs, which may present a problem for particpants with mobility issues. On the other hand, organizing the workshop in a location with frequent, reliable and accessible public transport is a an advantage, particularly for participants who can not or will not drive a car. Different countries have different attitudes and laws about certain groups of people, and it is important to ask in advance whether the chosen venue will be safe for the participants. For example, organizing a hack week in a country with anti-LBTQ laws excludes these participants from the start. To summarize, some relevant characteristics to check upon are: * Ease of obtaining travel visas + entry to the country at the border * Ease and expense of travel to/from location * Is the chosen venue safe for all participants, especially those belonging to minority groups? * Ease and expense of obtaining accommodation * Ease of communication for participants who do not speak the local language * Accessibility of the chosen location (for example, are the majority of buildings accessible to participants with mobility aids? Are braille signs widely available?) * Is public transport, wide-spread, frequent, reliable and accessible? We have so far not found a single location that agrees with all of those points. For recurring events, it may be a good idea to move the event around, in order to improve accessibility to different groups. One potential solution could also be to organize not one, but multiple events at the same time in different parts of the world, linked through e.g. dedicated video chatrooms, asynchronous chat organizations and other technological means. Especially for heavily oversubscribed workshops, this might allow a wider range of people to participate in these events. As of now, none of the hack weeks has tried this, though some (especially Astro Hack Week) are considering this model. Characteristics of the ideal Hack Week Venue The considerations above are meant to help organizers ask general questions about who will and who will not be able to attend the workshop, given the chosen location. However, ensuring that participants can physically attend the hack week is only the first step in providing a welcomin and inclusive venue for the hack week. The second set of considerations concerns the venue itself, i.e. the building and the room or rooms where the workshop will take place in practice. As with the discussion about the general location above, there are fundamental questions to ask about whether a venue is not just accessible, but actively welcoming to all participants. Can participants with mobility aids freely access the building without help? Are there signs and sound signals that help vision-impaired participants navigate the space? Are there gender-neutral bathrooms? Making sure that all participants feel welcome in the space where the workshop takes place is the first step towards building an inclusive learning community and workshop. Hack weeks live in part from the shared excitement and energy of working towards a set of common goals for a fixed, short amount of time. Having a central room where teams can work helps generate and sustain that energy. At the same time, these spaces can be loud and chaotic, which might actively impede progress during certain phases of a project, or be fundamentally unsuited to some participants. Having break-out rooms where teams can retreat for focused work in a quieter atmosphere is hugely beneficial, especially when those rooms are still physically connected in some way to the main location (e.g. visually through glass walls). For example, Astro Hack Week 2018 took place at the Lorentz Center in Leiden (NL). The venue provided a large room for about 50 participants as the main venue, in addition to a large coffee and break-out room, as well as shared office space for all participants. These spaces were all physically in close proximity, allowing project teams to spread out and work in whatever environment was most beneficial to their project and team culture. In addition, many participants may require some quiet time. A recent conference had a room designated as Introvert Alley , a room for quiet rest and relaxation, where participants could quietly read or work for a while. It should be made clear, however, that these spaces are not meant e.g. for participants to take phone calls, which might disturb other participants present. Beyond considerations related to accessibility, organizers should ask whether the space is designed for project work. For example, traditional lecture theatres are often set up in such a way that every participants faces the front of the room, and often tables and chairs are bolted to the floor. In these spaces, collaborative group work is difficult because it is difficult for participants to gather and work in groups. The ideal space for tutorials and project work is flexible and reconfigurable. For example, tables and chairs on wheels allow participants to quickle reconfigure the space according to their needs. Because project teams tend to spread out, it can be helpful to plan for a room that's about 1/3 larger than the designated group size (for example, one may want to book a room that can accomodate 65 participants for a group that is 50 participants large). Aside from the ability to reconfigure the room, there are several practical considerations: an ample supply of power outlets are crucial for workshops where the majority of projects will make heavy use of computers. Rooms where projects take place should also provide an ample supply of writeable surfaces, such as white boards or glass walls. Tutorials often involve slides or live-demos using a computer. Organizers should ensure that all participants can easily see the screen where the slides or demo are projected. For the hack weeks, we have often found it beneficial to provide coffee, tea, biscuits and lunch to participants during coffee and lunch breaks. These are valuable opportunities for participants to interact in an informal way, and providing coffee and lunch breaks in-house avoids the group breaking up into smaller sub-groups of people who already knew each other in advance. However, not all spaces allow food and drink: organizers should ensure that their spaces allow coffee and lunch to be provided close to or at the hack week venue. Several hack weeks have made use of the Active Learning Classrooms in the Odegaard Undergraduate Library at the University of Washington. These are interactive, collaborative spaces comprising a set of tables each seating nine participants, with power outlets for each participant in the center of the table. Each table also has its own screen, and the overall system allows the connection from any table to display either on that screen specifically, or project to all screens simultaneously. This allows all participants to follow along with tutorials regardless of where they sit, and also makes sharing results during the wrap-up easy. In addition, the room has small alcoves for about four participants along one wall, allowing for smaller group work in a somewhat sheltered space. These alcoves have tables and walls that are writeable, and the walls around the rooms can be used as whiteboards as well. These active learning class rooms are a great example of a space designed for interactive tutorials and project work, although they do lack break-out rooms that are physically separated enough to reduce noise and distraction. While food and drink were not allowed in the room itself, coffee and lunch could be served right outside. To summarize, here are some general considerations for the hack week venue: * Are the building and the rooms accessible and welcoming to all students? * Does the room in principle accommodate a somewhat larger number of participants than is projected to attend? * Is the room easily reconfigurable to address different needs during tutorials and project work? * Are there power outlets that are easily accessible to all participants? * Is there ample board space for writing, designing, and sketching out ideas? * Is there a system in place for displaying slides and tutorials, and is the screen visible from everywhere in the room? * Are there separate rooms where teams can withdraw for focused work? * Can one of those rooms be designated as a room for quiet time, to allow participants to temporarily withdraw from the controlled chaos of the hack week? * Does the venue allow food and drink either within the rooms or in close proximity?","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Venues/Venues-General/#venues-for-participant-driven-events","text":"The details of the space where the workshop takes place are often overlooked when organizing scientific workshops, but has in practice a huge effect on the dynamics and the success of a workshop, especially on participant-driven events like hack weeks (for a discussion about how physical spaces are key to data science collaborations, see also the MSDSE Report ). There are two key components to discussing the venue: the location (i.e. the country, city and location within the city) that the physical venue is located in, and the venue itself, i.e. the room or rooms where most of the interactions will take place. Below, we will discuss each in turn. Here, like with all parts of hack week organization, accessibility and inclusion are the key considerations that should come first.","title":"Venues for Participant-Driven Events"},{"location":"Venues/Venues-General/#location","text":"In organizing a hack week events are faced with opportunities and constraints related to the overall physical location of the venue. For example, it may be easier for an organizer to reserve rooms at their local university, or funding agencies might have restrictions on where the event can take place. There are, however, larger considerations that should play a role when deciding on a venue. For example, it may be difficult to impossible for participants from certain countries to obtain travel visas for the US and some European countries. Organizing a workshop in these countries may therefore exclude an entire group of potential participants. Similarly, flights to certain locations may be particularly expensive and/or cumbersome, requiring multi-day travel for the majority of participants. This, in turn, may exclude participants e.g. with childcare responsibilities, who do not want to spend an extra 3-4 days travelling, or participants for whom long travel is otherwise challenging. There is some trade-off: large cities often have more direct flights (and often also cheaper flights) available, but accommodation may be particularly expensive. This may present a challenge for participants from institutions or countries where funding for conference travel is scarce. Fundraising a significant amount of travel funding through sponsorships and grants can alleviate some of the financial concerns, and in some places, university accommodation might be available for much less cost than a hotel room would cost. Organizing the workshop early, with participant selection being completed somewhere around five months before the start of the workshop can also alleviate both costs and visa issues. Organizers should be prepared to provide some support (e.g. invitation letters) to participants requiring visas. In addition to accommodation and travel, it is worth asking how accessible the city where the hack week is located is to different foreigners. For example, a small town in France or Germany may be difficult to navigate for participants who do not speak those languages. Many old European cities have uneven cobblestone streets and buildings (especially restaurants or bars) made inaccessible by stairs, which may present a problem for particpants with mobility issues. On the other hand, organizing the workshop in a location with frequent, reliable and accessible public transport is a an advantage, particularly for participants who can not or will not drive a car. Different countries have different attitudes and laws about certain groups of people, and it is important to ask in advance whether the chosen venue will be safe for the participants. For example, organizing a hack week in a country with anti-LBTQ laws excludes these participants from the start. To summarize, some relevant characteristics to check upon are: * Ease of obtaining travel visas + entry to the country at the border * Ease and expense of travel to/from location * Is the chosen venue safe for all participants, especially those belonging to minority groups? * Ease and expense of obtaining accommodation * Ease of communication for participants who do not speak the local language * Accessibility of the chosen location (for example, are the majority of buildings accessible to participants with mobility aids? Are braille signs widely available?) * Is public transport, wide-spread, frequent, reliable and accessible? We have so far not found a single location that agrees with all of those points. For recurring events, it may be a good idea to move the event around, in order to improve accessibility to different groups. One potential solution could also be to organize not one, but multiple events at the same time in different parts of the world, linked through e.g. dedicated video chatrooms, asynchronous chat organizations and other technological means. Especially for heavily oversubscribed workshops, this might allow a wider range of people to participate in these events. As of now, none of the hack weeks has tried this, though some (especially Astro Hack Week) are considering this model.","title":"Location"},{"location":"Venues/Venues-General/#characteristics-of-the-ideal-hack-week-venue","text":"The considerations above are meant to help organizers ask general questions about who will and who will not be able to attend the workshop, given the chosen location. However, ensuring that participants can physically attend the hack week is only the first step in providing a welcomin and inclusive venue for the hack week. The second set of considerations concerns the venue itself, i.e. the building and the room or rooms where the workshop will take place in practice. As with the discussion about the general location above, there are fundamental questions to ask about whether a venue is not just accessible, but actively welcoming to all participants. Can participants with mobility aids freely access the building without help? Are there signs and sound signals that help vision-impaired participants navigate the space? Are there gender-neutral bathrooms? Making sure that all participants feel welcome in the space where the workshop takes place is the first step towards building an inclusive learning community and workshop. Hack weeks live in part from the shared excitement and energy of working towards a set of common goals for a fixed, short amount of time. Having a central room where teams can work helps generate and sustain that energy. At the same time, these spaces can be loud and chaotic, which might actively impede progress during certain phases of a project, or be fundamentally unsuited to some participants. Having break-out rooms where teams can retreat for focused work in a quieter atmosphere is hugely beneficial, especially when those rooms are still physically connected in some way to the main location (e.g. visually through glass walls). For example, Astro Hack Week 2018 took place at the Lorentz Center in Leiden (NL). The venue provided a large room for about 50 participants as the main venue, in addition to a large coffee and break-out room, as well as shared office space for all participants. These spaces were all physically in close proximity, allowing project teams to spread out and work in whatever environment was most beneficial to their project and team culture. In addition, many participants may require some quiet time. A recent conference had a room designated as Introvert Alley , a room for quiet rest and relaxation, where participants could quietly read or work for a while. It should be made clear, however, that these spaces are not meant e.g. for participants to take phone calls, which might disturb other participants present. Beyond considerations related to accessibility, organizers should ask whether the space is designed for project work. For example, traditional lecture theatres are often set up in such a way that every participants faces the front of the room, and often tables and chairs are bolted to the floor. In these spaces, collaborative group work is difficult because it is difficult for participants to gather and work in groups. The ideal space for tutorials and project work is flexible and reconfigurable. For example, tables and chairs on wheels allow participants to quickle reconfigure the space according to their needs. Because project teams tend to spread out, it can be helpful to plan for a room that's about 1/3 larger than the designated group size (for example, one may want to book a room that can accomodate 65 participants for a group that is 50 participants large). Aside from the ability to reconfigure the room, there are several practical considerations: an ample supply of power outlets are crucial for workshops where the majority of projects will make heavy use of computers. Rooms where projects take place should also provide an ample supply of writeable surfaces, such as white boards or glass walls. Tutorials often involve slides or live-demos using a computer. Organizers should ensure that all participants can easily see the screen where the slides or demo are projected. For the hack weeks, we have often found it beneficial to provide coffee, tea, biscuits and lunch to participants during coffee and lunch breaks. These are valuable opportunities for participants to interact in an informal way, and providing coffee and lunch breaks in-house avoids the group breaking up into smaller sub-groups of people who already knew each other in advance. However, not all spaces allow food and drink: organizers should ensure that their spaces allow coffee and lunch to be provided close to or at the hack week venue. Several hack weeks have made use of the Active Learning Classrooms in the Odegaard Undergraduate Library at the University of Washington. These are interactive, collaborative spaces comprising a set of tables each seating nine participants, with power outlets for each participant in the center of the table. Each table also has its own screen, and the overall system allows the connection from any table to display either on that screen specifically, or project to all screens simultaneously. This allows all participants to follow along with tutorials regardless of where they sit, and also makes sharing results during the wrap-up easy. In addition, the room has small alcoves for about four participants along one wall, allowing for smaller group work in a somewhat sheltered space. These alcoves have tables and walls that are writeable, and the walls around the rooms can be used as whiteboards as well. These active learning class rooms are a great example of a space designed for interactive tutorials and project work, although they do lack break-out rooms that are physically separated enough to reduce noise and distraction. While food and drink were not allowed in the room itself, coffee and lunch could be served right outside.

Lorentz Center Leiden The Lorentz Center is a venue for organizing interactive workshops, run by the University of Leiden and the Dutch funding agency NWO. Leiden is a half hour by train from the Amsterdam Airport, which is a major European air travel hub. The Netherlands have a dense system of public transport (mostly train and bus), which also connects internationally to Belgium, France, Germany and the UK. The Netherlands are a relatively tolerant and open culture, with high levels of English language fluency in the cities. The Lorentz Center itself provides rooms, monetary funding and significant administrative help with organizing the workshop. The Center provides a room that fits of the order of 50 participants, and while not fully configurable (there are rules about fire safety), tables and chairs can be moved around and adjusted. On the same hallway is also a set of offices, and each participant is assigned a desk in a shared office for the duration of the workshop. Participants used these offices for focused project work as well as break-out sessions. The Lorentz Center requires an application ~12-18 months in advance of the workshop and is available for workshops across the natural sciences, computational sciences as well as the humanities and social sciences. While it is not stricly necessary to have a researcher based in the Netherlands on the organizing committee, one mandate of the Center is for workshops to engage the Dutch research community, where inclusion of a researcher based at a Dutch institution can be helpful. The Center provides several thousand Euros worth of funding for each accepted workshop, in addition to the rooms, coffee breaks, administrative support, and a conference dinner. They also provide lunches and access to bicycles at a discounted rate. We organized Astro Hack Week 2018 at the Lorentz Center, and had very positive experiences with the Center. The staff are extremely professional and well-organized, which reduced the burden on us as a committee significantly. They worked closely with us and were flexible enough to accommodate some of our particular requests, such as our application + registration procedure. Many of the practices administrative matters, like hotel block bookings, caterings and buses for the conference dinner, were organized without us having to think about them in detail, which was extremely helpful. The two weaknesses we identified were the lack of air conditioning and the difficulty to arrange a live-stream and recording for our tutorials. Astro Hack Week coincided with a major heat wave, which made it hard for participants to concentrate on occasion. The Lorentz Center is also technically not set up for live streaming, and bringing in our own equipment came with some challenges (most notably, the variable upload data rates).","title":"Examples"},{"location":"Venues/Venues-Ideas/#past-and-potential-venues-for-hosting-hack-weeks","text":"Hack weeks can and have been hosted at universities, for example in university library spaces or active classrooms.
