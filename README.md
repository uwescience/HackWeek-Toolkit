# A Toolkit for Organizing Hack Weeks

Intrigued by the idea of hack weeks, but don't know how to start? 
Seems too complicated to organize? This repository is for you! We're building a 
toolkit to help you get started with organizing your own event. 

In this repository, you can find general information, resources and templates 
for various components. 

## Contents

[under construction]

* Website Template
* Hack Week Organization Checklist
* Other resources (e.g. the paper)
* A running list of existing events (add your own!)
* Facilitation Notes, ideas and activities
* Tutorial topics and resources
* Wiki Template
* template application form questions
* template Jupyter notebook for Entrofy application procedure

## Contribution

Contributions are not only welcome, but highly encouraged!

Hack weeks are still a new concept, and we're learning new things 
every time. Expect the contents of this repository to change as we 
learn and evolve. Please consider adding your own resources, ideas 
and experiences so that we and others can learn from you!

## Technical notes

* This documentation is built and deployed using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).
* install mkdocs from conda-forge: ```conda install -c conda-forge mkdocs```
* To develop locally: ```mkdocs serve```
* To publish to GitHub: ```mkdocs gh-deploy```
* This uses the markdown extensions [admonition](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/extensions/admonition/) and the markdown plugin [markdownextradata](https://github.com/rosscdh/mkdocs-markdownextradata-plugin/)
* edit the mkdocs.yml file to customize the hackweek name and website to your particular event
